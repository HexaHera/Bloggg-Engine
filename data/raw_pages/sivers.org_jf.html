	This is a real question.
	I don’t know the answer and I’m curious.
</p><p>
	I lived in New York City for ten years and Los Angeles for seven years, and there are a lot of Jewish people in those two cities, so it could be coincidence.
</p><p>
	But I honestly didn’t realize it until one day I was thinking about the difference between shallow versus deep friendships, and made a list of my closest friends.
	After I looked at the short list, smiling and appreciating, I looked again.
	Wow.
	All of them are Jewish.
<strong>
	Is it coincidence, or a cultural attraction?
</strong>
</p><p>
	I meet a lot of people and like most of them, but it’s rare I feel that extra-extra click with someone.
	In Buenos Aires this year, I met with <a href="https://sive.rs/met/127">a musician named Alejandro Staro</a>, and we instantly felt like old friends.
	Then two hours into the conversation, he said something about his Jewish culture, and I was shocked.
	I had no idea.
	If that was part of the reason I felt an instant click with him, how could that be?
</p><p>
	When I got home to New Zealand, I called one of my best <strong>non</strong>-Jewish friends, to ask her about this.
	She’s from Iran, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD_Faith">Bahá’í faith</a>, and spent twenty years fighting terrorism on the front-lines of Afghanistan, Somalia, and Kenya, before taking a nice peaceful post in 2019, in Kyiv Ukraine.
	Oops.
	(Yes she’s a magnet for disaster, and has also been attacked by a dolphin and silverback gorilla.)
	But anyway.
	She’s also one of those rare people that I super-clicked with the minute we met, years ago.
	So I explained the situation and asked her why I’m so drawn to Jewish people.
</p><p>
	She said, “Maybe that’s why you and I clicked so well.”
</p><p>
	I said, “Ha. Wait. What? No. You’re Bahá’í.”
</p><p>
	She said, “Yeah but my mom’s mom is Jewish, so it was always part of my family’s culture.”
</p><p>
	Again!
	I had no idea, so it was another blind taste test.
</p><p>
	So if this is a cultural attraction, then what is that really?
	My friends are <a href="/book/InventJewish">vastly different</a>, some religious, some not at all, from different countries and backgrounds, so any cultural similarity must be subtle.
</p><p>
	Could the <a href="/book/JudaismCI">Talmudic tradition</a> of questioning pass down through non-religious families?
	Is it a shared love of discussion?
</p><p>
	I could relate to the worldview presented in “<a href="/book/JudaismCI">The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Understanding Judaism</a>” — a surprisingly great book, written by a rabbi.
	My friend <a href="https://www.mayasolovey.com/">Maya</a> inducted me as an honorary “member of the tribe”.
</p><p>
	Am I recognizing a shared worldview in strangers, even though they seem to have nothing in common?
	Or is it something else entirely?
	I don’t know, so I’m asking the world for ideas.
	Please leave a reply here if you have any thoughts.
