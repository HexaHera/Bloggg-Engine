<h1>Hell Yeah or No</h1>
<p><strong><em>what’s worth doing</em></strong></p>
</header>

<p><strong>
Useful wisdom. Simple profound mental models to guide your decisions.
</strong></p>

<p>
Overwhelmed?
<strong>
If you feel anything less than “hell yeah!” about something, say no.
</strong>
We say yes too often.
By saying no to almost everything, you leave space and time in your life to throw yourself completely into the few things that matter most.
</p><p>
After Derek Sivers’ “hell yeah or no” rule was adopted by podcasters, bloggers, and investors, he compiled related ideas into this useful, profound, and surprising book around the themes of <strong>what’s worth doing, fixing faulty thinking, and making things happen</strong>.
Examples:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Be proud to be a <strong>slow thinker</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Goals shape the present</strong>, not future.</li>
<li>Assume you’re <strong>below average</strong>.</li>
<li>Life has <strong>no speed limit</strong>.</li>
<li>What’s <strong>obvious</strong> to you is <strong>amazing</strong> to others.</li>
<li>Relax for the same result.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The first 15,000 early buyers of ‘Hell Yeah or No’ have posted hundreds of 5-star reviews at <a href="/n">sive.rs/n</a> — but it is now being released to a wider audience.

<h2>Editorial Reviews</h2>

<p>“Derek Sivers is one of my favorite humans, and I call him often for advice. Think of him as a philosopher-king programmer, master teacher, and merry prankster. I might need to do a second volume of my next book 100% dedicated to the knowledge bombs of Derek Sivers. So much good stuff. Hard to cut.”<br>
<small>— Tim Ferriss, author, 4-Hour Workweek</small></p>

<p>“A deceivingly small book packed with endless wisdom. Each chapter is a life lesson. These stories help me keep the most useful mental models fully usable every day.”<br>
<small>— Frank Corrigan, economist</small></p>

<p>“I can’t say enough about this book. Pound for pound, it has the most useful and insightful information of anything I’ve read in the last few years. Derek Sivers is a true philosopher of our time.”<br>
<small>— Chris Perry</small></p>

<p>“This book was one of the best surprises I’ve had in a while. You don’t think you’ll really learn something completely new after reading many other great thinkers. Hell Yeah or No is now one of those books I recommend for people I really care about.”<br>
<small>— Romulo Gomes Nunes, entrepeneur</small></p>

<p>“I quote these vignettes in board meetings, meditation sessions, and to children. These short chapters are easily to relate to across all walks of life. The simplicity makes them so profound. I bought several of these books to share with friends. I didn’t buy enough.”<br>
<small>— Austin Moss, Sweetwater Sound</small></p>

<p>“When unsure about what to do, I open my copy of this book then close it having found the answer. We all possess an internal navigation system that knows the best way forward, but life has a way of burying that system in a heap of fear, habits, and uncertainty. Think of this book as a super-tool to help you clear the debris and rediscover what you already know. Highly recommend!”<br>
<small>— Manny Vallarino, musician</small></p>

<p>“The power in this little book is hard to overstate. Life is about making decisions. If you learn the framework for making decisions as outlined in this book, you can have a happy life and the career you desire.”<br>
<small>— Ellen Twomey, founder of You Are TechY</small></p>

<p>“There are two books I would take with me on a desert island: Meditations by Marcus Aurelius (written 180AD) and Hell Yeah or No by Derek Sivers (written 2020AD). There have been billions of books between these two book-ends, but these two direct your mind on a better, less worrisome path.”<br>
<small>— Lars Christensen, manager, marketer, designer, toolmaker</small></p>

<p>“Lovely, easy to apply patterns of wisdom that anyone can benefit from exposure to. This book is on my shortlist of books I re-read every quarter, and I’ve gifted it 9 times to friends, family and co-workers. The world would be a better place if everyone read this book, truly.”<br>
<small>— Jason Schmitz</small></p>

<p>“A philosophy book with practical elements, written in a gentle and kind tone. I particularly enjoy Derek’s concise writing style. There isn’t one extraneous word in this book. The brevity means that I’m more likely to refer to this book for ideas or alternative perspectives, than a meatier tome.”<br>
<small>— Úna Ní Fhlannagáin, award-winning Irish harpist</small></p>

<p>“This is one of the most useful books I have ever stumbled upon! Through stories and great questions, Derek provides a framework for thinking through life’s real problems. I often find myself listening to the audiobook when I’m struggling with an problem and inevitably, Derek has a question that reframes it, sheds new light on it and often a solution follows.”<br>
<small>— Brett Shikaze, lawyer</small></p>

<p>“Philosophy books can be incredibly cerebral and often inaccessible. This book somehow maintains the pithy wisdom and sweet juices of complex ideas, while keeping them brief, memorable, and shareable. The brevity of each micro-chapter makes it easy to digest, and the density of the ideas make them quite filling. I have updated aspects of my life because of some of the radical thoughts I found in this book. The entries are like perfectly polished little stones. There’s something very satisfying about reading content that is smart, where the author has opted to eschew all fluff.”<br>
<small>— Richie Trucke, musician</small></p>

Original. Personal. Concise. Warm. Inviting. Conceptual. Practical. Beautiful. Clean. Provoking. For sharing. Accessible. Easy. &#39;How does Derek do this?&#39; &#39;I want to try writing like this&#39;.

&quot;Hell Yeah or No&quot; is a compilation of insight and wisdom that Derek Sivers has learned and applied over the years as a businessman and human being. Sivers is a minimalist and it&#39;s evident in his writing; it&#39;s poetic. His words are chosen carefully in order to get his ideas across in the most efficient way possible, with the least amount of words possible.  The audiobook is read by the author. Derek&#39;s voice is soothing to listen to and his reading is clear. He reads with conviction and passion. I can only give his books my highest recommendation.

I bought several of these books to share with friends. I didn&#39;t buy enough. I quote these vignettes in board meetings, meditation sessions, and to children. These short chapters are easily to relate to across all walks of life, but the simplicity is what makes them so profound. While all of these chapters are lifted from Derek&#39;s blog with the URL cited at the bottom of the page, there is something lovely about having a paper copy beside a plate of food and in front of a glass of wine. Buy a few copies because your friends are going to want one too!

Hell Yeah or No is an inspiring easy read. I have now read it through twice. It contains numerous thought provoking ideas related to taking action and changing perspective. It has become one of my 4 &quot;morning books&quot; that I rotate through and read a chapter from each morning to ensure a successful start to the day.

The power in this little book is hard to overstate. Life is about making decisions. If you learn the framework for making decisions as outlined in this book, you can have amazing things like a happy life and the career you desire. I wish this was required reading in high school, but since it&#39;s not, pick one up so can use the right framework from which to make decisions. It just might change everything in your life!

&quot;Hell Yeah or No&quot; is the perfect book to read and reflect on life. While it is a short book, I recommend reading it slowly, digesting each section one at a time.  My girlfriend and I have been reading this a section at a time and Derek&#39;s pithy writing never fails to spark deep thought and conversation. Looking forward to his next one!

I found this book to be full of valuable insights as to the human experience, and advice on what to do with one&#39;s time on the planet - from the micro, to the macro!

This book is bursting with wisdom. Read one chapter, then let it churn in your head for a week. <br><br>Hard to choose one passage to mention, so at random, in “Relax for the Same Result”, Derek discusses how, one day, he backed off his usual “full-throttle” bike ride and took it easy (but not super easy, just like 50%). <br><br>The whole mood of the ride lightened up- he noticed dolphins and birds. At the end of the ride, he looked at his watch and realized that this relaxing ride was only a couple of minutes slower than the “push to the limit” ride, yet he gained so many unexpected benefits. <br><br>I’ve tested this in life. Back off the work and professional throttle just a bit, and watch deeper relationships with family, friends, and the world blossom. Honestly, I’m not sure why, but in doing so, I haven’t even lost the couple of minutes that Derek did on his bike ride. Buy the book.

What I love about &quot;Hell Yeah Or No&quot; is the digestibility of the content. Each chapter is a tiny nugget of info that makes the book easy to pick up at any time, read a few entries, then leave it on the coffee table to come back to later. I&#39;ve really enjoyed this relationship which is almost like a thoughtful roadside billboard while on a roadtrip--a quick interaction, but the sentiment sticks with you on your journey. Derek&#39;s words can be so impactful that I often write down a few snippets of them on sticky notes, and stick them around the house to remind myself of what I&#39;d read that day that resinated with me. <br><br>The book&#39;s physical size is also a complete joy to hold, or at least that is what I&#39;ve come to discover the more time I spend with it. It feels like a hard cover collection of field notes.<br><br>It is worth your time to read and contimplate what you are saying &quot;yes&quot; to, and really think on the &quot;why&quot;. By making mindful agreements on your trajectory, you may come to find out that you need to alter your course more frequently than previously realized.

This book was one of the best surprises I&#39;ve had in a while. You don&#39;t think you&#39;ll really learn something completely new after reading many other great thinkers (from Seneca to Naval), but Derek certainly conquered his place in my shelf after I read this book.<br>I loved the conciseness of it and how tangible he wrote his advices while still keeping it open enough for a lot of people like myself to identify with.<br>Hell Yeah or No is now one of those books I recommend for people I really care about.

Ever since gobbling up this deceptively simple book, it has migrated back and forth between my desk and bed to be revisited … and revisited … and revisited. Each one-to-two-page-long &quot;chapter&quot; introduces an IDEA. Derek has distilled years of journal writing and pondering to focus on three key topics: what’s worth doing, fixing faulty thinking, and making things happen. <br><br>Small paradigm shifts and questions like these can be life-changing. Are you local or global? Why do we do what we do? Are you present or future focused? How slow can be better than fast. How assuming we are below average can take us farther. Even the title, “Hell Yeah, Or No” has impacted my own decision making in large and small ways. SO liberating!<br><br>Ever since Derek Sivers headed CD Baby years ago, he has stood out as an independent thinker with innovative ideas that he is generous enough to share with us. I am grateful for this book and will buy his others. Just brilliant. Thank you thank you thank you!

&quot;Hell Yeah or No&quot; is short and easy to read. If you think books need to be full of text and long, then this book is not for you.<br><br>(Generally, a book is allowed to be a book, even if it doesn&#39;t have a lot of text.)<br><br>The best advice is often short. If you&#39;re not paying attention, you might blink and miss it. When advice is excellent, but short, sometimes you need to have it in a form you can hold in your hand to remind you of its importance.<br><br>I think the essential idea behind Hell Yeah or No is, first, that your life is limited. Your resources are limited. To use your time and your resources for anything less than what could bring you the most joy is a disservice to you and the people around you.<br><br>The good news is that, in general, we have more options than ever before. The bad news is that we have to make choices under imperfect information. Derek says that the level of enthusiasm for something at the point of decision is the best indicator you have for whether something is worth doing.<br><br>Also, you&#39;ll eventually hit the point in your project where your motivation wanes. To finish what you start, you need as much reserve as you can get.<br><br>This is a humane little book. You will feel better after reading it. I recommend it.

Hell Yeah or No is a small book filled with wisdom. I read it the first time when it first came out, and it helped me in making some important choices in this last year.<br><br>Derek&#39;s philosophy made me question if I really wanted to work a 9-5 at 23 years old.  I choose to do a PhD for the next 3 years.<br><br>It also helped me decide if it was better to go live alone or to stay with my parents for another couple of years and put together a sufficient amount of money to then have more freedom of choice when it will come to choosing where I want to go.<br><br>But it also helps me on a daily basis with small choices that when added up make me a better person.<br><br>I cannot recommend this book and this author enough, it can give you new lenses through which you look at life.

He shares stories on how to live. To live as us, not as him. <br><br>On page 126, Derek writes. “Sometimes people ask me if there&#39;s one motto or rule of thumb I use most often. This is it: ‘Whatever scares you, go do it.’”<br><br>I am Derek.

I wasn&#39;t sure at first that this was the book for me. I mean, what did it have to do with the music industry? And why the hell did Derek leave music behind? Is he nuts? It&#39;s hard to pinpoint one thing that I learnt from this book, because I learnt so many things. Being a complex chap, I often grapple with questions, for which I seldom find answers. Derek&#39;s book puts things into perspective in a way that makes me think. And so all I can say is this: I doubt very much that you can read this book without it having an impact. It will give you clarity and insight from a totally different angle than what you&#39;re used to. But only you will know what that clarity and insight will be...

This book is as valuable as expected and then some more... &quot;Valuable as expected&quot; to the point that, and once I got the paperback version, I turned it into a kind of capsule in time for my decision-making throughout life...

So that I can later on, and throughout the years, go back to revise decisions made and lessons learned and to re-read it again and again. And &quot;then some more&quot; because at the midst of all the golden nuggets this book already provides there is one &quot;story&quot; that is the definition and base of one of the best reasons and ways to walk this earth and life: 232 Sand dollars.

The idea of “Hell Yeah or No” has become Internet-meme worthy, and is over 10 years old now. From listening to Derek on various podcasts, it seems it’s been a recurring piece of work that he is known for widely. This book, subtitled “thoughts around what’s worth doing, fixing faulty thinking, and making things happen.” is a combination of decision-making strategies, perspective-shifting exercises, and thought-provoking stories. Derek is a fan of directives, of cutting to the chase of whatever it is that worth sharing, not messing with wrapping ideas in needless details, and this book could be read as such. The titles alone are takeaways, let alone the chapters themselves (which are all short). Cracking.

What a powerful set of ideas, wisdom and tips to help us stay on track with our true values and calling!!  Derek&#39;s pithy way of sharing just the right things with a powerful punch is refreshing. I listened to the audio version, and found it to be a comforting yet gently nudging friend after dropping my son off at school. I plan to have my 19 year old entrepreneurial son listen next. Thanks Derek!

We often say our priorities are one thing, but then our actions say otherwise. Why? Because too often we say &quot;yes&quot; to mundane tasks and busywork, until, eventually, we&#39;re buried in stress and discontent and everyone else&#39;s &quot;urgent&quot; tasks. <br><br>Derek Sivers shows us there&#39;s a better way. To prioritize, we must say &quot;no&quot; to everything that gets in the way, so we can say &quot;yes&quot; to only that which is important. &quot;Hell Yeah or No&quot; is a guide into this insight. Throughout these pages, Sivers helps the reader understand &quot;what&#39;s worth doing,&quot; not just intellectually, but viscerally.

I loved this book. Longer review here: https://www.catherinekunst.com/hell-yeah/ but let me sum up: Some of the “learnings” are so obvious that I am embarrassed that I needed someone else to write them down. To give me the freedom to say “hell yeah.”<br><br>More importantly this is a book about “no” because if the inspiration isn’t “hell yeah” the answer should be “no” across everything – the work you are doing, the people you make time for, the things you are thinking about, or spending time on. Just no. Simple and yet difficult. “Your actions show you what you actually want.” And saying no, makes the space in your life for doing those things that you truly want.

Every chapter in this book is gold. There are a few I think about all the time: &quot;How to stop being rich and happy,&quot; and &quot;Imitate! We are imperfect mirrors,&quot; and &quot;Think of what you&#39;re miserable NOT doing.&quot; Now I want to go back and listen to the book again. Sivers&#39; way of thinking is always fresh and unique, yet full of common sense and wisdom.

I possess very few physical things but I own all of Derek’s hardcover books. <br><br>At first I did not understand WHY I needed to own physical copies of his books. Especially because I already owned digital copies of them. Plus, I hate stuff and am always trying to get rid of everything. Books included. <br><br>So when he announced he was selling physical books IT MADE NO SENSE TO ME THAT I WOULD WANT TO BUY THEM! But I also could not NOT buy them. <br><br>And then they arrived. <br><br>I opened my package, took the books out (happened to LOVE the way they looked but that was still not my “why” for buying them). <br><br>I eventually found a home for them on a windowsill…<br><br>And then one day I walked into my living room to find my (not so) little kid holding his book. And it all made sense to me. <br><br>Even if you don’t have any kids, it still makes sense to get the books - for you and for anyone else who might come across them.

Sivers, more than anyone else I read, has a way of finding new perspectives with which to view everyday things. He thinks from first principles. I absolutely love engaging with his writing and reframing of the world.<br><br>Here&#39;s an example, and one of my very favorites: he was buying a house to live in with his son. It had a big living room. But he didn&#39;t want a living room; he doesn&#39;t just sit around on a couch and hang out and relax like most people do in living rooms. But then he realized the room was just a room, and could be anything he wanted it to be. So he called it a &quot;making room&quot;, a room where he and his son go to make things. A soon as he did that reframe, he loved the house.<br><br>Each essay is 1-3 pages long, but has a lot of depth. Not every essay will resonate with every reader, and that&#39;s perfectly OK. There will be enough gems that hit home to make the whole, short book worthwhile for just about anyone.<br><br>Here&#39;s an except that I&#39;ve been thinking about literally for months:<br><br>&quot;Most musicians first record songs in the studio, then go perform them in concert. Fela Kuti did the opposite. He performed only new unrecorded songs in concert. Then once he recorded them in the studio, he&#39;d never perform them again. I couldn&#39;t help but notice the similarity. It&#39;s as if to him, the recording was the end of the life of a song, instead of the beginning. It makes just as much sense if you think about it that way.&quot;

Hell Yeah or No makes the deceptively difficult art of choosing so clear. If you can&#39;t say yes to a project enthusiastically, say no.

As much as I love reading I am surprised how rarely a book can be considered life changing.  &#39;Hell Yeah or No&#39; is on my short list of life changing books. As soon as it was available I bought 20 copies to give to friends, family, and colleagues. So far 10 of them have contacted me to share something they changed about their lives as a result of reading this excellent book. Before becoming a Tim Ferriss Podcast fan I had never given a book as a gift (this is one of Tim&#39;s standard interview questions).  The blog post this book is titled for changed my life so I had to buy the book as the first one I&#39;ve purchased to give as a gift.  Makes sense being that I first learned of Derek Sivers through his appearance on Tim&#39;s podcast. Thanks for the wealth of information and insights you share through your work Derek. You are helping people around the world with your work.

I can&#39;t quite remember how I came across Derek Sivers, but there&#39;s a lot of &quot;First Principles&quot; thinking embedded throughout the notes/thoughts in this little book.  Even if you are familiar with many of of these ideas, it was wonderful to see it all together in this very enjoyable collection.  <br><br>&quot;Hell Yeah!&quot; is about ruthlessly prioritizing things you enjoy doing.  Related ideas about (myth of) context-switching/multi-tasking etc. come to mind as well as thoughts about when to poll and be interrupt-driven (almost never!).  I am happy and grateful for what I am doing, but we tend to have a lot of these discussion at home with our kids so sometimes a simple message like this is quite helpful.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;am a very slow thinker&quot; resonated with me as did a few other thoughts.<br><br>The shopping experience is pleasantly minimal, a bit of a throwback compared to the large online shops.  In my early days of Internet, I was naive enough to imagine that we could be shopping like this one day ...<br><br>Overall, bottom line is to develop or tune your &quot;First Principles&quot; (thinking or doing things from scratch).  This is a easy to read collection that drives home that and similar ideas.

I love this book! I rarely get the opportunity to say that, but I am saying it here. If you like the insightful wisdom of Seth Godin, condensed to short bits you can ruminate and advance the quality of your life daily, even in your busy schedule… you’ll love this book. I find myself returning to it for one short chapter per day, often. It is not a one and done book like so many today. Derek continues to challenge your mind with wisdom that enriches your life with each short chapter. Including the wisdom in Chapter 25 which includes what that Pelican did to him while riding his bike along the 7.5-mile trail along a Santa Monica beach.

HELL YEAH OR NO exists in the intersection between practical and revelatory. Derek&#39;s stories and ideas are incredibly personal, but at the same time, they hold up a mirror and ask the reader, &quot;What do you see in yourself?&quot;<br><br>And more importantly, they ask, &quot;What *didn&#39;t* you see before?&quot;<br><br>I&#39;d highly recommend HELL YEAH OR NO to any creative person who feels like they&#39;re stuck or languishing.

I&#39;ve been following Derek and his writings for years. This book is as insightful and thought pondering as all of his other writings. It&#39;s well worth the time to read, which won&#39;t take very long, because Derek writes to get the point across and not to add more words to his tomes to make them appear of more substance ( and costly to print). There is plenty to think about in all of his writings, even the single sentence ones he scribes. Highly recommended.

I am quite attached to this book. It should be required reading for all people as they first enter into the complexities of their life. It helps a person see things from many different perspectives and dimensions. Each chapter is a delightful morsel to sample like a dessert in a 5 star restaurant. Tasty and leaving you wanting more. Then the sad moment comes, you&#39;ve finished the book and there&#39;s nothing left!! Then just re-read it! I&#39;d say Hell yes to this book.

What I love about Derek is that he focuses on quality instead of quantity. This book contains so many gems, if you would re-read or re-listen to it every month, I&#39;m convinced you would find new learnings every time. What really helps me to memorise most of the content are the great stories Derek used to transmit his messages. Best example: I still remember exactly how he describes his red face while riding his bike at a high speed!<br><br>Great read, and has the potential to be a timeless piece I can always come back to.

I have always found the greatest learning comes from compact wisdom. In “Hell Yeah or No”, each chapter can inspire profound realization and positive change.<br><br>For example in talking about how actions reveal our values, Sivers says, “Start doing what you say you want to do, and see if it’s really true.” Simple, right? But as a person raised to always be pragmatic instead of true to my vision, this was profound, because I had ten other pragmatic projects distracting me from my dream. Putting those aside, I found focus and instant joy pursuing my ultimate goal. That makes it clear to say &quot;No&quot; to the side projects, and &quot;Hell Yeah&quot; to doing the work I love.<br><br>[Kelly Ian Hobkirk]

Let me just say, having finished it yesterday, I went straight on and started on a music project I&#39;d lost interest in last year. Listening to this book/words just made me think<br><br>&quot;HELL YEAH!&quot;<br><br>So at the very least it was inspirational.<br><br>What I liked about it is he doesn&#39;t come across as a “typical expert” who goes into technical stuff to make themselves look clever. It is best summarised as simple statements backed up by anecdotes that tell the story and amplify with real life examples. <br><br>Clearly the song writer in him comes out very strongly.<br><br>I found it interesting and it challenged my thoughts at times, and even made me highly aware that perhaps (in the aforementioned music project) I just needed to make a decision.<br><br>And that I did.

This is a great book, I need to walk around with a &#39;Hell No&#39; necklace, or write it on my hand to make sure I remember. I also love the story of how Derek Sivers started CDBaby, by helping fellow musicians when they needed a hand uploading their information to a website, which would have been time consuming and I&#39;m sure he had other things to do. Just a nice guy helping other people. It is good in that moment he didn&#39;t say &#39;no&#39; even though he probably didn&#39;t feel like it. This moment of saying yes, when many others could easily have said &#39;hell no&#39; led to the making of an incredible company. So, in summary, it is good to say &#39;No&#39; more often, if you can help someone out it is good to make an exception and say Hell Yeah too. Thank you for making this book!!!

Derek’s book is always very thought provoking. I know some people say that ohh these are all just blogs (as they have links on the bottom of each article in the book), and they felt like they didn’t need to pay for it. I think that’s for the better. You don’t NEED to pay for the knowledge, for sure. Sivers has everything online for free, so everyone could learn. This is something that I LOVE about. I grew up in China where knowledge is a privilege not a right. I feel like sometimes copyright is similar where the bar is so high for normal people to reasonably reach (e.g. Microsoft charging $$$$ for their OS &amp; office suite, Adobe, etc.) <br>I chose to buy it because <br>1) it’s well organized, <br>2) it’s physical, <br>3) the book texture feels AWESOME (inside paper AND the cover), <br>4) it’s a really nice little gift for friends (instead of sending them links). <br>5) I can support the other writer back a little, as printing/publishing costs money. <br>You certainly don’t NEED to buy it but I would buy it again for sure!

“Hell Yeah or No” by @sivers has become a sacred book of wisdom for me. When I came out of a nearly two year retirement (that I thought would be permanent) in 2017 at 39 to give back to my industry as an educator and assist high potential dental entrepreneurs to achieve their dreams, I thought it would be very part-time. However, by 2019 there were so many new opportunities that I was working full time and traveling for work extensively.  <br><br>In the Fall of 2019, I decided that in 2020 I would restore balance and significantly reduce my time at work. I did this prior to the recent pandemic and I have continued to do so into 2021. This restored focus has allowed me to apply the Hell Yeah or No concepts more fully and has awakened my creativity again. <br><br>So far in 2021, I have founded two new businesses with amazing partners that will impact the dental industry and beyond for years to come, and my other businesses continue to thrive while maintaining a more balanced life of joy and happiness. <br><br>This gift could not have come without the wisdom I have gained from @sivers over the years, including this book.  <br><br>Thank you for that gift Derek!  I appreciate you and your “counter melodies” to conventional wisdom.

The sort of book that you’ll keep coming back to again and again for a fresh dose of inspiration, motivation, and clarification.

I am a 27-year-old musician (composer, pianist, conductor) living in Amsterdam.  I was recently very impressed and inspired by the reading of his two most recent books.<br><br>Having reached today the end of &quot;Hell Yeah or No&quot;, I feel very grateful.  It appeared to me that a smart way to show my appreciation of his work would be to apply his advice to my own life and to keep him updated as to what unfolds. That way, I will have made sure I keep breathing in... and out.<br><br>I am grateful for those two wonderful books.

“Hell Yeah or No”, by Derek Sivers is a short book organizing some of the author’s blog posts. Since I enjoy his writing and especially his extensive book list, this was an instant purchase.<br><br>Below are my favorite quotes and links to the mini-chapters I found most interesting. (29 out of 67! 11 (in bold) that I liked in particular, since those are blog posts, they are freely available.)<br><br>This book also reminded me of my all-time favorite talk: “Steve Jobs Stanford Commencement Speech“.<br><br>https://gordonschuecker.com/2020/08/20/book-notes-hell-yeah-or-no/

I read Hell Yeah or No and found the bite sized life lessons good. They are easy to relate to and I&#39;m following some of them.  Also love the cheery yellow cover.

The book is comforting, appropriately objective and rational, challenging and illuminating.<br><br>I am inspired, with new tools, to write my book, continue to write and publish my poetry, find composers to write music to lyrics I have written for songs and to lay back and not get in my own way. Life is too short. And someone, somewhere may need to read or hear what I write. If my works are memorialized through publishing, then my legacy will have manifested. Sigh. I just want to leave something.

A really cool book to come back to then and again. There is some much that can help you reflect your own life - or start an exciting discussion with your spouse or a friend. It&#39;s succint, deep and fun. What else do you want from a book?
