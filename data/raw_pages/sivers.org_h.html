<h1>How to Live</h1>
<p><strong><em>27 conflicting answers and one weird conclusion</em></strong></p>
</header>

<p><strong>
Not quite non-fiction, not quite self-help. It’s a work of art about conflicting philosophies.
</strong></p>

<p>
<strong>Many books believe they know how you should live.</strong>
But each book disagrees with the next.
In “How to Live”, each chapter believes it knows how you should live.
And <strong>each chapter disagrees with the next</strong>.
</p><p>
One chapter makes a compelling argument for why you should be completely independent, keeping all options open. The next chapter argues why you should commit to one career, one place, and one person.
</p><p>
One chapter persuades you to be fully present, and experience each moment. The next, to delay gratification and invest for the future.
</p><p>
Which one is right? Which does the author believe? All of them. It's <strong>a philosophy of conflicting philosophies</strong>.
</p><p>
A very unique and thought-provoking book.
Meant for reflection as much as instruction.
</p><p>
113 incredibly succinct pages of profound insights.
No philosophers are quoted.
No -isms are named.
Only <strong>actionable directives</strong>.
The end result feels more like poetry than prose.

<h2>Editorial reviews:</h2>

<p>“Always brilliant and succinct, I guarantee you have not read a book like this before. 27 life philosophies on how to live a good life, each feeling profound and incredibly true, yet somehow they all manage to contradict each other… you know, like life. Derek is brilliant. He’s full of pithy wisdom and quirky ideas. I love his brain and love his books. If you want something different, yet still readable, check it out.”<br>
<small>— Mark Manson, author, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</small></p>

<p>“Derek Sivers is one of my favorite humans, and I call him often for advice. Think of him as a philosopher-king programmer, master teacher, and merry prankster. I might need to do a second volume of my next book 100% dedicated to the knowledge bombs of Derek Sivers. So much good stuff. Hard to cut.”<br>
<small>— Tim Ferriss, author, 4-Hour Workweek</small></p>

<p>“One thing ‘How To Live’ doesn’t do is tell you how to live. Yet, after reading it, you might be closer to answering that question for yourself. Half self-help and half art, it beautifully transcends its genre. Seriously one of my favorite books.”<br>
<small>— Johannes Wilke</small></p>

<p>“A thrilling, exhilarating, life-affirming, daring, psychedelic roller-coaster ride in a hall of mirrors through the wisdom of the ages. I initially began to highlight some phrases, but I soon realized my entire ebook was yellow. How To Live is the most unique book I’ve ever read and surely one of the best. And if any of this sounds like hyperbole, the book is better than anything I just said.”<br>
<small>— Michael Colucci, theater founder and director</small></p>

<p>“Brilliant. Derek’s best book yet, and for me possibly one of the best books ever. Brilliant format, actionable directives, and provides the best possible answer to the loaded question of how to live. Every chapter and every sentence is thought provoking, so much to ruminate on. Pure substance, 0% fluff, which is so rare.”<br>
<small>— Diego Montejo</small></p>

<p>“‘How to Live’ is an absolute piece of art. I started hoping that it would teach me the secrets of how to live. But no, in the middle the conflicting messages led me to the real message: that there is no right way to live. There are pieces of life that we gather from everyone, to build ours. I’ve been re-reading almost every single day and the message keeps getting clearer, like a good wine. It is a big inspiration.”<br>
<small>— Lucas Vilela, developer</small></p>

<p>“I absolutely LOVE this book. I’ve read thousands of books and I think it’s my favorite. I was planning to highlight, but every sentence is so well-thought-out and important, it would just end up being a yellow book!”<br>
<small>— Matt Wickstrom </small></p>

<p>“Magnificently succinct. So elegantly terse that it feels utterly complete. The sheer craftsmanship/sculpting of the language is just breathtaking. I read a LOT, and my mind is bending at the sheer discipline, effort and ruthlessness it must have taken to whittle this down. Rather than lose substance it actually gains body/mass and impact. Un-frickin’-believable. Really outstanding.”<br>
<small>— Zubin Pratap, founder</small></p>

<p>“It’s deep, really deep. Just like a Buddhist koan, the more you meditate on it the more you uncover within your own mind, the more you understand. If I said any more I would spoil it. What should be a relatively simple premise made me think more, and deeper, than I have in a while. What more could you want from a book?”<br>
<small>— Colin Walker, writer</small></p>

<p>“In ancient Greece, various schools (Stoics, Epicurians, Hedonists, etc.) each offered their own philosophy for how to live your life. This book is the closest thing I’ve found to a modern version of that. Each of the 27 short chapters makes a different argument for the right way to live. The chapters blatantly contradict each other and while your instinct is to ask, “so which one’s right?” the book’s ending gives you a better way to look at it. (I won’t give it away!) I ended up buying the ebook and reading it slowly over the course of several months, taking dozens of pages of notes along the way. I felt like I was trying on each philosophy like an article of clothing to see how it fits. It was a lovely exercise, and one I’d recommend to anyone.”<br>
<small>— Bryan Braun, developer</small></p>

<p>“This is the ultimate self-help book. By that, I mean it’s the last one you'll ever need to read. After this, every other equivalent will seem one dimensional by comparison. It destroys an entire genre.”<br>
<small>— Rowan Simpson, investor</small></p>

<p>“How To Live is probably THE most remarkable book I’ve owned and read and gifted. Never, never, have I been so engaged and challenged by someone’s writing and perspective on the topic of day to day living. This book is, without doubt, the one that has had the most profound effect on me. EVERYONE, but everyone, should read this. But be prepared for the book to sit close by at all times. It’s vital reading to constantly ensure that we genuinely connect with our true intentions in life. This book is a 21st Century Masterpiece.”<br>
<small>— Chris Craker, producer</small></p>

<p>“Reading it. Reflecting on it. Pausing after reading a few sentences. Arguing with it. Agreeing. Re-thinking. Arguing again. It’s the best thing ever written about living. I love every atom of it. A masterpiece. And a truly useful life handbook. It’s the book I will keep revisiting over and over again — the book I will gift to my loved ones.”<br>
<small>— Jade Panugan, Craftdeology</small></p>

<p>“The most powerful art piece I read this year. Read it in order, slow and focused. Don’t skip to the conclusion earlier. It will change you. Every time I read it I discover something new.”<br>
<small>— Mihai Hly Hlodec, developer</small></p>

<p>“WOW I loved ‘How to Live’! I’ve recommended it to a few of my close friends and I tell them honestly that it’s one of the most unique books I’ve read. It’s not really fiction or nonfiction, it’s a meditation.”<br>
<small>— Michael Poyatt, musician</small></p>

How To Live has a provocative subtitle that becomes clear very early. The subtitle is: 27 Conflicting Answers and One Weird Conclusion<br><br>Turns out, the subtitle is perfect for the content of the book. I loved How To Live, in all its glorious contradictions…and perhaps because of them. After all, those very contradictions make it clear that we are all required to process and embrace conflicting thoughts, feelings, ideas, and goals. Every day. That’s life.<br><br>On every page, How To Live defies the conventional wisdom that there are no new ideas under the sun. And yet, those new ideas paradoxically illuminate the archetypal wisdom of the collective unconscious. How To Live oxygenates ancient bedrock wisdom and supercharges it with post-modern enlightenment. <br><br>It is a sui generis prescription for the next evolution of our species in some undiscovered country. I would put How To Live among the list of great books mentioned in the “Follow the Great Book” chapter.<br><br>How To Live defies description and is impossible to summarize, because the key takeaway is the feeling you get while reading it. Typically, I share what this book or that book said. How To Live is different. I feel compelled to share my experience, my feelings while reading it:<br><br>It is a thrilling, exhilarating, life-affirming, daring, psychedelic roller-coaster ride in a hall of mirrors through the wisdom of the ages compressed into a laser beam of passion for life and love for humanity.<br>I initially felt I was reading something outside the box, but I soon realized there wasn’t a box within light years.<br>I initially began to highlight some phrases, but I soon realized my entire PDF was yellow.<br>This is not merely a self-improvement book, it is a riveting novel about living life in which the protagonist—yep, that means you—becomes a superhero in a whirlpool of ecstasy about being alive…and getting better every day. <br><br>How To Live is the most unique book I’ve ever read…and surely one of the best. And if any of this sounds like hyperbole, the book is better than anything I just said.<br><br>Thank you, Derek.

This book is infuriating because diametrically opposed ideas make perfect sense and I can pull examples from my own life for both extremes.<br><br>This book is stimulating in forcing me to recognize the fundamental contradictions in my life and helping to navigate them.<br><br>This book is difficult to read because it&#39;s so concentrated that I need to stop and think about every sentence.<br><br>This book is practical in helping me fit my own decisions to different approaches to life.<br><br>This book has no stories.<br><br>This book helps me to understand and rewrite my own stories.<br><br>This book is eternal.  I&#39;ll be re-reading chosen in random chapters to see how they fit my changing moods, circumstances, and decisions.

How to Live is one of those books that feels like a ride in a theme park. The kind that goes through different themes, you have no idea what to expect and even if you do, you leave each theme with a different impression. This is short-lived because immediately after, you have a completely new adventure waiting for you.<br><br>Each chapter takes you to different corners of your own beliefs or misbeliefs. It challenges us to reshuffle our thoughts to a new conclusion.<br><br>This is what happened to me with the very first chapter, Be Independent. These two words surfaced certain ideas and feelings but as you go through line by line, your thoughts travel through agreeing that dependency is bad, to being ok with a little dependency, cheering for independency, and then being not so sure of it all. It&#39;s not clear what the author actually believes on these topics. The voice in the book is neutral, crisp, and unemotional, because instead of trying to impose a point of view is thinking aloud and trying to make sense of what life means and how to live it best.<br><br>As the book surveys a wide range of topics that cover all different areas of life, a curation that is carefully handpicked, we land towards the last third of the book, On Love. It&#39;s a beautifully written poem to love; not the kind that we read about or see in movies, but the love that is lived and experienced. The love that we grow to love. I felt that every single line was nuanced, perfectly relatable, and written out of first-hand real experience. No sugar-coating, no downplaying, no cliches. This chapter speaks with so much truth and authority and it was the most relatable piece on love I&#39;ve read in a long while.<br><br>The book is a collection of 27 independent pieces. And just like hopscotch depending on what you read first your perception on the content might change. It is a book to read, re-read, and experience. One of those living pieces that speak to you in different ways depending on your day.<br><br>The abrupt conclusion at the end feels less like a plot twist and more like a friendly nudge. The book is meant to be an experiment. It invites you to change your view. The voice is less transparent about what &quot;it&quot; actually thinks. Instead, it wants us to reach to the conclusion ourselves, that there is not one way to live life and it&#39;s up to us to make it what we want it to be. How freeing and terrifying that is. Enjoy the ride!

This book elicited many emotions and thoughts for me, which at times seemed contradictory. At times I found it exciting then frustrating, open-minded then dogmatic, obtuse and then insightful. As I continued to read, I realized that I was taking it literally, while (in my opinion) it isn&#39;t meant to be taken literally. That allowed me to step back from focusing on the specific &quot;recommendations&quot; (I use quotes here deliberately), and instead think about the juxtaposition of the different--and often contradictory--ways to live described in each chapter. If they are contradictory, they can&#39;t all be true, can they? And yet they are.<br><br>One of the great rewards of the book was seeing my own evolution towards that realization. At the end (and even a bit before), I realized that it&#39;s about the journey of living. At different times in your life, there are different ways to live. None of us is static, I am not the same person I was 20 or 30 or 40 years ago. It doesn&#39;t necessarily make sense for me to live the same way now as I did then. The question that fascinates me now and that the book really got me to consider is, am I consciously making choices about how I live, or am I letting outside circumstances dictate how I live? Who is in charge? Shouldn’t it be me?<br><br>And that, for me, was the greatest insight of my journey through the book. If you&#39;ve never thought about how you are living, or if you have but want to refine that thinking, then I recommend the journey to you, too.

The beauty is in the curation of these individual atomic units of wisdom, each building on the last within their specific scope. It&#39;s in finding the connections between seemingly disparate pieces and being able to thread them into a meaningful narrative as though they belonged together from the outset.<br><br>The book&#39;s tagline is &quot;27 conflicting answers and one weird conclusion&quot; but, once you get over the initial surprise, it&#39;s not really that weird at all. It&#39;s deep, really deep. Just like a Buddhist koan, the more you meditate on it the more you uncover within your own mind, the more you understand. If I said any more I would spoil it, but read it and you will get there sooner than you might expect.<br><br>The subtitular 27 answers are indeed conflicting, at least to a point, and you might think &quot;why would I want to read something that doesn&#39;t give me one true answer?&quot; Oh, but it does, you just have to find your own way there — follow the subtle signposts until you reach that &quot;Aha!&quot; moment.<br><br>This time, the atomic units of wisdom do more than build, they become entangled into an amorphous quantum energy that feels ready to explode at any moment. It is a wonder that each answer is presented and argued as eloquently and passionately as the one before — in isolation, each could persuade you that it is, indeed, how to live. But, think on them a moment longer, and you can observe that entanglement in action, tease out some finer threads that would have been far more apparent were the answers provided in a different order. Again, the beauty is in the curation, in the deliberate juxtaposition of &quot;truths&quot;.<br><br>What should be a relatively simple premise made me think more, and deeper, than I have in a while. What more could you want from a book?

Loved this book on two levels.<br><br>One, the answers contain a bunch of useful, practical approaches that are worth trying in different life situations if one is stuck, bored, or simply needs a paradigm shift, a gentle push, to move to a next stage of life.<br><br>Two, the truly conflicting nature of these answers makes you realize how what you hold true today, may not be true for you tomorrow, and may never be true for somebody else. This also makes you see that your beliefs and coping strategies are arbitrary and the real question is not how to live (because the answer always starts with &quot;It depends on...&quot;), but what are you really looking for? At the end of the day, the human being is looking for peace of mind, happiness, satisfaction, fulfilment, contentment.<br><br>The conflicting nature of the 27 answers reminds you that your happiness  doesn&#39;t depend on how well or which answer you execute given their arbitrary nature. Your happiness depends on your relationship to the outcomes that any of these answers may produce for you, which relationship may be loving (acceptance) or hateful (resistance).<br><br>The genius of the book lies in that it doesn&#39;t tell you &quot;this is how it is&quot;, but walks you through these different answers and lets you arrive at your own conclusions.

I was mostly slightly depressed throughout the pandemic - not realising how much I had relied on interacting with other people in the workplace in the past to regulate my own mood.  Being on my own at home, left to my own devices I had allowed myself to descend into unhealthy inactivity and negativity.<br><br>“How To Live” was a turning point for me in that I started imagining having more control over how my life might turn out or what mood or mental state I want to be in.  I’m still very much a work in progress but l’m getting there thank God.<br><br>I had never read self help books before, but “How To Live” is quick to read.<br><br>It enabled me to imagine me playing a different hand to the cards that I have been given in life.<br><br>The book sort of enabled me to see my life as a song and see myself as the sound engineer who has the control deck in front of me.<br>I can tweak any setting I want.<br>One chapter may have ‘spontaneity’ turned up to 10 and ‘planning’ ahead turned down to 1.<br>Another chapter will have those settings reversed and so on.<br><br>Each chapter describes how to apply these various settings to in your life, in practice.

In the best way possible, this was one of the most challenging books I’ve ever read.<br><br>It’s not confusing. It’s actually one of the easiest to read books I’ve ever read. But Derek Sivers has tapped into a truth that few (if any) other authors have understood: their perspective is one of many right ones.<br><br>So instead of ‘picking’ a side, Derek presents them all, not as a debate, but as heart-felt individual takes of the world.<br><br>This creates a challenge because now you HAVE to engage the material. You can’t say yes to everything (like most self-help books encourage). Instead, you have to look some of these heartfelt opinions dead in the eye and say “No, not for me”.<br><br>And this is one of the first times I’ve ever read a book that has forced an action out of me. <br><br>It’s uncomfortable.

This book stayed with me.  I got WAY more out of the audio book than reading it.  The points he makes are more impactful hearing them for some reason.<br><br>For me, it’s his most impactful work as it offers an olive branch between differing ideologies and lifestyle choices.<br><br>By far the biggest thing is it gave me perspective on how other people live and the pros and cons to those choices. I’ve been too judgmental in the past and this book — somehow — made me come to terms with and accepting of other people’s lifestyle choices.  It’s a huge gift.  Instead of being annoyed now, I just look at the pros of their choices and move on.  The huge negative to my choice (absurdly forward thinking / stoicism) was losing my twenties and thirties to having my head down with my business.<br><br>At one point in the book, on the money chapter, @ 2hr 26min in, it’s like he was talking right at me.  I had to pull my car over.  The losing steam / gratification reduction part of earning money I had never heard anyone else talk about.  Ever.

No book has made me contemplate so many times while reading. The moment I was done with the last page, I had my diary out to capture my understanding from each of the 27 answers to that one principal question, how should I live.<br><br>As Derek says in the subtitle of the book, they are all conflicting answers. But the conclusion is not weird at all — for one, Derek is a masterful and a deep thinker. Each short chapter has most knowledge presented in the least number of words possible.

But, dig deep, and it is one of the most difficult books to fathom. It will force you to question what you have believed throughout your life, and it’s that questioning that will leave your mind unclouded.<br><br>It’s easy to write long, elaborate prose. But it takes time to shorten it, and I am glad Derek took that time. In his words, it took him four years, often writing 16 hours a day, to condense it down from the first draft of 1300 pages to 115.<br><br>What results is one of the most powerful and important books ever written.

I’m quite a black-and-white/binary thinker on things. I always want hard-and-fast rules I can apply to my entire life — like “never lie under any circumstance”.<br><br>“How to Live” was great because it was essentially 27 self-help “books” around my way of thinking. All of them resonated in the first couple of paragraphs, and induced a sense of dread by the end where I realised if that’s the path I chose, how much I value would be left on the table.<br><br>It helped me to think that there’s nothing wrong with having goals or priorities.

Sivers has reached an epitome of clarity in his latest masterpiece that would make Hemingway want to come out of his grave.

Derek says that this is his best book ever, and I fully understand that an author is always going to have his/her own perspective on a book, not just because of the experience of bringing it into being, but because of what he/she hopes the book might achieve. It is that latter reason, I think, that inspired Derek to say this was his best book ever. He is truly trying to challenge existing paradigms for &quot;how to live&quot; in a world with so many conflicting messages.<br><br>Like me, you may find yourself deeply underlining the sections you agree with and almost speed-reading the sections you don&#39;t. But that&#39;s the point: you need to be willing to immerse yourself in the &quot;alternative&quot; world view of every chapter in order to get the overarching message: there is no one way to live your life.

Ernest Becker once wrote: &quot;The problem of man’s knowledge is not to oppose and to demolish opposing views, but to include them in a larger theoretical structure. One of the ironies of the creative process is that it partly cripples itself in order to function. I mean that, usually, in order to turn out a piece of work the author has to exaggerate the emphasis of it, to oppose it in a forcefully competitive way to other versions of truth; and he gets carried away by his own exaggeration, as his distinctive image is built on it... There is a great pressure to come up with concepts that help men understand their dilemma; there is an urge toward vital ideas, toward a simplification of needless intellectual complexity. Sometimes this makes for big lies that resolve tensions and make it easy for action to move forward with just the rationalizations that people need. But it also makes for the slow disengagement of truths that help men get a grip on what is happening to them, that tell them where the problems really are.&quot;<br><br>Derek&#39;s genius little book acknowledges this problem, satirises it, and overcomes it in a way few other books have ever managed. And he does it, naturally, with typically beautiful, penetrating panache.

The contradictory advice from chapter to chapter starts out jarring, and ends up perfectly harmonious. The book is full to the brim of timeless advice; and Derek encourages the reader to incorporate the things that speak to you and discard the rest. It is both/and, both duck and bunny. The book for me is a field guide of how to live, drawing from many different life philosophies. I consider it a buffet of knowledge rather than a prix fixe meal. You’ll find things that speak to you on your own journey. A lesson in efficiency; no fluff or unnecessary words. A masterpiece that I’ll return to over and over throughout my life.

If I had to pick the best quote from the book, I would have to quote half of it.<br><br>At first, I thought that the book is about extremes, and the author&#39;s intention is to convict readers that no &quot;way of life&quot; is superior to another. <br><br>There were some &quot;ways to live&quot; that entirely resonated with me. Others don&#39;t. So I thought that maybe the book will help me find my way of life from all possible and stick with it. As if everyone should choose one set of clothes and wear them for the rest of their life. <br><br>But it was the conclusion that has enlightened me. We don&#39;t have to choose one set of clothes and wear it for the rest of our life, we can change clothes during our journey. You may love wearing jeans, but when you are about to swim you should change, otherwise you won&#39;t appreciate the experience of swimming. The same in life, there are moments in your life when you should change the comfortable &quot;independence&quot; to (possibly uncomfortable) &quot;dependence&quot; in order to fully appreciate some moments in your life. Moreover, you can combine multiple &quot;ways to live&quot; together; you can be both &quot;dependent&quot; and &quot;loving&quot;; other times &quot;independent&quot; and &quot;pursuing wealth.&quot; You are the composer; you can decide when each of the &quot;ways to live&quot; plays.<br><br>This book is like freedom, both inspiring and overwhelming. Answering the question &quot;ok, so what should I do now?&quot; hasn&#39;t become any easier.<br><br>Derek did a great job gathering convincing arguments on each of these 27 &quot;ways to live&quot;. It required open-mindedness, curiosity, self-doubt, and of course, life experience.<br><br>Masterpiece.

It is really good.<br><br>But: I&#39;m a Sivers fan. 10 years ago I sent him an email out of the blue because I knew that he had moved to Singapore and I wanted to do the same. Lo and behold, in good old Sivers fashion he replied and introduced me to a young accountant who would eventually help me to set foot into the country and start a business and quite quickly get my PR status. 10 years later, this very accountant is still working with me, I made a fortune in Singapore, married the love of my life and somehow I feel forever a little bit indebted to Derek because he sent me, a complete stranger, that one contact.  So I am biased.<br><br>Being an expat and traveller, an entrepreneur, a musician, a designer, a creator, a rebel, a humanitarian and a husband myself, I found myself nodding along. &quot;Yeah, I get it.

Actually, I think the first read should be fast, so you get the whole picture. But that will leave you wanting and unimpressed.

Wow. I&#39;ve been following Derek Sivers for many years and at some point had the feeling I was hearing the same ideas over and over again in podcasts, his books, etc. Wrong. Derek was writing this masterpiece. It&#39;s probably the most highlighted book I&#39;ve read. Every sentence forces you to stop and reflect.<br><br>If there&#39;s one &quot;but&quot; -this being a &quot;good but&quot;- it&#39;s that you need to be ready for it. If this is your first reflection at life, or you haven&#39;t lived enough, you probably will miss the profoundness of this book. If this is not the case, grab a highlighter with plenty of ink in it, stop the world, and read this.

How To Live is a fascinating assortment of ways to live that quite often are “dialectical” in their contrarian approaches.  One chapter says “Be Independent” and the next chapter says “Commit”, which could be interpreted as the opposite in some ways; however, both concepts are right depending on circumstances.  He does this throughout the book and the pictures in the Conclusion sum it up best: Life depends on perspective, which can have more than one meaning and you are the conductor of it!

Derek is the modern day epitome of &quot;How to Live&quot; himself. He has lived a charming unique life, embodying his principles.<br><br>This book is the mark of a Zen master. Each argument is like a zen koan - makes you think, nudges your mind open.<br><br>Each thought is like a mental reprogramming trip. Every chapter starts with a compelling counter-intuitive thesis about that argument, piles up evidence, shows how that thought is beautiful &amp; enriching, how you can live by that perspective on multiple aspects of your life and how it makes life beautiful in its own way.<br><br>And then, the next chapter gives you another surprising thought!<br><br>Derek&#39;s books are a workout for your mind - they keep it flexible and supple.

Going between each directive was like riding the waves of a chaotic river. You’d get taken up, thinking you’re on a great ride then you’d change direction, back down, left, right, up again. I loved the roller coaster of it all. I found it best to read 1 or 2 chapters per day and let it sit. Absorb the ideas and think how they’d apply to your own life. I’ve already reread a couple of the chapters. What’s beautiful is that they all imply each other. You can’t be independent unless you commit. You can’t pursue pain unless you know the feeling of doing whatever you want now. A wonderful coincidence of opposites.

Having looked forward to getting my hands on his latest book for ages now, I&#39;ve just had the pleasure of finishing &quot;How to Live&quot; by Derek Sivers. <br> <br>The book is his response to &quot;Sum: Forty Tales from the Afterlives&quot;, which offers 40 different answers to the question &quot;What was life all about?&quot; from the perspective of you having just died and suddenly finding out. Every answer is unique and frames life as something very different, and totally changes how you *would have* lived had you knew the answer while alive. <br> <br>&quot;How to Live&quot; is almost the companion, but aims at exploring what life might be about now – while you&#39;re still experiencing it and while you can still change it. <br> <br>The book contains 27 very different answers to the question &quot;What should I do with my life?&quot;, all taking a completely unique perspective about what&#39;s important. I had to read it with a very open mind, as there&#39;s a lot to disagree with when you take 27 different extreme answers of any one question, but read right the book is wonderfully provocative and leaves a lot of Derek&#39;s philosophies floating around your mind, challenging your own positions. It&#39;s so broad that you&#39;ll almost certainly find a version of your current lifestyle in there, as well as a few ideas about how it could be very different... if you wanted it to be. <br> <br>If you&#39;re into that sort of thinking – being mentally poked and prodded about profound choices, or things you didn&#39;t even necessarily consider as choices – it&#39;s an awesome book. For me it created lots of good questions about everything from lifestyle, love, and purpose to where I should be and what I should be doing. <br> <br>Here&#39;s a little quote that stood out (among many others): <br> <br>&quot;There’s only one difference between a successful person and a failure. A failure quits, which concludes the story, and earns the title. Your growth zone is your failure zone. Both are at the edge of your limits. That’s where you find a suitable challenge. Aim for what will probably fail. If you aim for what you know you can do, you’re aiming too low.&quot;

This book is a magnet of ideas that I will read once a year.  Some ideas attract you, some repel you.  But they all make you think, consider, imagine, contemplate, and dream.  They say in life, you start off sledding down a fresh snowy hill, climbing up and doing it again.  Soon you have a well-worn path and you go down the same way every time.  It&#39;s hard to break free from that path, the sides are tall, they keep you going the same way every time.  What&#39;s it going to take to change?  A new sled? A new hill? A new you?

There&#39;s no one way to live, and this book is a great place to start figuring out all the options. Every chapter was convincing, and that&#39;s funny, because sometimes there were back to back chapters which contradicted each other!

They taught me things about myself and made me ask questions that I was uncomfortable voicing. <br><br>There&#39;s one chapter that is titled &quot;Follow a great book&quot; which advices the reader to pick a book and stick with it, and explore life through its lens.

Derek Sivers is a modern philosopher with ancient wisdom. <br>The existential question brings the reader to navigate those seas where each of us has  drawn. In this book the  journey is easy to read and with a winning concise style that enchants you to keep on going,  just like life. <br>Sivers lays a path of alternative options how to live life that doesn&#39;t  seem to promise a goal, the final destination,  the answer.<br>Yet the reader keeps finding lighthouses that shed light on the path they&#39;re actually in their real life. <br>Like in a multitude of universes and dimensions that all are possible, Sivers offers a buffet of ingredients that the reader can leverage on to create their own recipe of how to live their life. <br>Sivers is aware that every human being is a spectrum of different colours that paint one&#39;s life, so the reader is encouraged to be resilient with oneself, and mix and match the advices on how to live that more suit their frequencies. <br>There are several powerful keys in Sivers&#39; work: enthusiasm, exploration, expression, commitment, yet detachment, with a pinch of Stoicism, Hedonism, and Buddhist Zen. All mixed with practical  advices keeping in mind our modern society.<br><br>Highly recommended to adults and teens, as it&#39;s never too early or too late to consider _how to live_ ?

I love this book. It makes you think about things you typically don&#39;t think about, ideas that you&#39;ve come to take for granted as your own - without ever questioning them. Give it time, don&#39;t rush through it. It&#39;s gold.

I don’t know how Derek keeps upping the ante, but everything I see from him provides me with a new perspective on how to view the universe and navigate the waters.  “How to Live” is the latest example where the life lesson statements he makes are just as good individually on their own as they are collectively in chapters or in the book as a whole.  If you were looking for a comprehensive methodology on to live your life and to better your philosophies on how to approach your life, “How to Live” is definitely for you.

As with all of Derek&#39;s books so far, epiphanies and breakthroughs are inevitable.

There are many ways to be creative and make things happen in life. There are also many approaches to how to live one’s life. Derek Sivers’ book, “HOW TO LIVE,” provides 27 different approaches or attitudes toward life and the challenges we may face. <br><br>This book showed me ways to deal with changes in my surroundings, as I mature and grow older. There is not just one way to live. Some things in life are not totally within my own control. However, as this book points out, the outcomes in my life may have a lot to do with my outlook on life. <br><br>It seemed that Derek’s advice to me was to take pause and reflect, if possible, before reacting to circumstances or making decisions about things. Then, once I react to someone or something, and once I make a decision about something, it’s time to move on and make the best of it. <br><br>One way that reading this book has affected my life, is that I’ve decided to pay more attention to my love of music. Now, I’m committed to devoting loving attention to it and appreciation for it every day. As I’m having fun learning daily --while singing and playing my guitar, or other instrument-- I want to share, connect, and empathize with others as they learn too.<br><br>This book is well written, and succinct. Take it all in, chapter by chapter, with an open mind. I’m looking forward to listening to the audio version of it now.

Derek Sivers once again confirms through his latest book How to Live that he is among the most thought provoking, compassionate, and important life coaches of his generation. <br><br>What Derek artfully reveals in this text is a wisdom of when the mind of science meets the passion of soul. He provides a plethora of cohesive and powerful options in considering how best to navigate through this journey we call life. <br><br>Regardless of your station, identity,  age, or inclinations,  How To Live is a must read.

There is something truly powerful about work that helps you truly appreciate the beautiful nuance and open roads of life.

How to Live is one of the best and most enjoyable books I&#39;ve read in a while.

There are no half-hearted answers and it&#39;s clear that Derek put serious thought into presenting each one in a convincing way. Yet, just in the next chapter he may turn that answer upside down and present the opposite perspective with the same level of confidence.<br><br>This book is like a supermarket of ideas.

It was a privilege to read this book. I’m a slow reader because I only read at night, but that turned out to be a benefit, because it allowed me to sit with each mindset presented in each chapter for a day or two before moving on. Each chapter shamelessly contradicts the previous, as if you are traveling the world talking to different people with completely different advice. You keep what works for you, and learn to recognize and empathize with how different people lead their own lives. Intriguing concept that’s beautifully implemented. Obrigado Derek!

This is a weird, interesting, insightful book.<br><br>Most books on this topic give you ideas and tactics from the author’s perspective — things they have done that have worked well. The idea is that if you integrate those ideas into your life, then you will also have a better life.<br><br>This book is different.<br><br>Instead of saying “do this” and your life will be better, it says, “here are 27 different ways to approach life. Sample them and see which ones works best for you.”<br><br>The weird part is that most of the “27 ways” contradict each other.<br><br>Some of them are complete opposites — you can’t do both. At least not at the same time.<br><br>I love this book because it demonstrates:<br><br>* That “the best way” is not the same for everyone.<br><br>* What is “the best way” during one phase of your life might not be “the best way” at other times.<br><br>* Other people might have a completely different approach to life, and that’s okay.

How to read.<br>Find a book. Not just any book. Your time and attention is worthy of a great book. One written with humor and intention. A book that is written in language that is digestible so that the authors thoughts are transferred to your mind. A book written with intent - a book where the author wants you to walk away with their ideas firmly transferred. <br>Make sure the ideas are worthy of your attention. You want to be challenged not by the complexity of the language, but by the thoughts the words provoke.<br>Take it slowly. Savor your time with the book. Try reading a chapter a day. Really work to understand the meaning. Consider whether you agree or not and if so why or why not. <br>When you finally finish the text, you may come to realize that you have changed your thinking. Perhaps you understand better why you have made past decisions. Or perhaps you may decide to chart a new course.<br>The act of transferring our thoughts into someone else’s mind across space and time is a miracle. Enjoy this process.<br>This is how to read.

The first few lines from this book captivated me, and the rest of the book was equally good. Sivers offers 27 different approaches we can follow to Live a Good Life. Various approaches will appeal to various people, and Sivers caters to a wide range of people. Some approaches are the opposite of each other - for example, Be Independent vs Commit, or Chase the Future vs Value Only What Has Endured. In most cases, however, there are multiple approaches that the reader can adopt. My sense is that picking one approach and aligning one&#39;s life in accordance with that approach non-negotiably, while optionally adding other approaches, is optimal. All this said and done, this book is filled with gems and nuggets of wisdom in every page, a one-of-a-kind book. My gratitude to Derek Sivers for writing this masterpiece and simultaneously making the world a better place.

This is a book for thinking people. Those who seek quick recipes might be fascinated by one chapter but immediately confused by the next. So it is not a good idea to stop reading at any chapter - you must consume all and contemplate on all of them. The book looks packed with recipes - but there is none. You are solely responsible for your decisions. So decide - and live - every second.

Distilled and tight... each chapter has comprehensive ideas around a way to live and optimizing a lifestyle for that focus.  I found myself nodding yes to much of the pros and cons and envisioning my life with aspects of that focus.  The big question is really how to optimize the choices, because the rewards and costs are more complex if you meld multiple lifestyle choices rather than hyper-focus on one!  Thought provoking and enjoyable.  Read straight through on one long cross country flight and then I have gone back to revisit certain chapters.  The hard work for me is still to come, which is really thinking more deeply about my optimizations and choices... am I allocating time correctly?  Are my outcomes and trade-offs what I want?

You don’t have to agree with everything, as sometimes we are just not ready to hear or learn some lessons. It’s a book to carry with you and re-read through life as we evolve we read it differently.

HOW TO LIVE is such a compelling book. In life we often have the temptation to go all in on one philosophy. In this book, many philosophies are taken to their extremes and this allowed me to see both the strengths and the things that ring true to me, but also the ways that they can go too far. I haven&#39;t finished it yet, but I already get the sense that my conclusion will be we have to be an amalgamation of these philosophies to be our best, most authentic self. Beautiful book that really makes you think. Thank you.

Truth lies within the paradox. Perhaps the best way to describe How To Live is through this Zen fable: &quot;One day in late summer, a farmer was working in his field with his old sick horse. The farmer felt compassion for the horse and desired to lift its burden. So he let his horse loose to go the mountains and live out the rest of its life.<br>Soon after, neighbors from the nearby village visited, offering their condolences and said, “What a shame. Now your only horse is gone. How unfortunate you are! You must be very sad. How will you live, work the land, and prosper?” The farmer replied: “Who could say? We shall see.”<br>Two days later the old horse came back rejuvenated after meandering in the mountainside while eating the wild grasses. Returning with him were twelve new and healthy horses which followed the old horse into the corral.<br>Word got out in the village of the farmer’s good fortune and it wasn’t long before people stopped by to congratulate him on his good luck. “How fortunate you are!” they exclaimed. You must be very happy!” The farmer softly said, “Who could say? We shall see.”

You can strike it big on the positive side as long as you&#39;re careful not to be too literal.

An imposing title with a glib subtitle for a long life&#39;s worth of big-thinks.<br><br>I&#39;ve taken Sivers&#39; counsel to &quot;read slowly, one line at a time&quot; seriously.

Sometimes a person needs a little push to break them out of a down cycle. This book certainly provides that push, and some significant insights from the one-sided arguments as well. I took a long walk this morning and my brain was filled with noise, but I thought about the chapter about doing nothing, so each time my thoughts wanted to spring to action, I told my mind to be still and to do nothing.

Life is about choices and without dedicated intentions and attention to your thinking and actions you can end up not living the life you want.

Awesome exercise in multifaceted wisdom. It&#39;s like going to 27 different people and asking them to give you the best advice they can--and of course their views are going to conflict. But that&#39;s precisely the point: take in everything that resonates with you, leave the rest behind. And Sivers provides ample resonance throughout. <br><br>Each section thus works twice: by itself and by contrast with other sections.

&#39;How To Live&#39; packs a lot of wisdom into concise sentences and sections. I love its complete absence of wordiness, attitude or &#39;airs&#39;. A book like this can only be written by someone who has really lived it. <br><br>It has a lot of unconventional ideas. I love unconventional, contrarian thinking - and I need all the encouragement I can get. On page 48, &quot;Here’s how to live: Pursue pain.... avoid pain, you avoid improvement... The softer the chair, the harder it is to get out of it.&quot;<br><br>I really appreciate the way that Derek refrains from telling me to get out of the comfy chair. I don&#39;t want anyone telling me what to do. Instead, he simply explains that comfort is ultimately incompatible with ambition.

What I love about Derek&#39;s books is that he isn&#39;t afraid to tell the truth. Most other books sugarcoat the truth and it gets watered down that way. If you want to succeed at what you love, you&#39;re going to have to make some hard decisions. You have to ignore what everyone else is doing and work hard on mastering your craft. It&#39;s true, many ideas in this book are contradictory and at first that threw me. But if you use these ideas as more of a suggestion then you can take what works for you and leave the rest for someone else. Overall, it&#39;s an inspiring read and if you take action, it can change your life.

The book has a simple formula -- take some good life advice, and then start expanding on it until it gets to absurd extremes. This is repeated for 27 chapters with one chapter per one advice.<br>Because it follows a formula, it gets a bit repetitive and predictable, although most chapters still are gems. The writing style is a bit unusual, it&#39;s very rhythmic and poetic, and it took me few chapters to start digging it.<br>What I liked most about this book is recognizing principles that I personally live by.

Taken bit by bit - which is suggested at the beginning, there are nice lessons in here. Taken as a whole, it felt like someone bought a bunch of fortune cookies and laid out the fortunes in thematic order. The parts I appreciated the most or at least wanted to keep reading were the stories - but they were too few and far between. This book felt like it was meant to be paper/hard back and put on my desk, so that every once in awhile I could pick it up, read a few lines, then go about my day thinking about it. It&#39;s not really consumed as a pdf/ebook/audio book, because there is no time to think between the lines. That&#39;s why, I think, stories worked better - it let me build and envision the world built through that story and the moral of it or the lesson was revealed by the end. Instead of a lesson after lesson after lesson.

I&#39;m reading it slowly like Derek recommends and still haven&#39;t finished (22 down, 5 plus conclusion to go). It is fun to switch from one argument to another - even though I usually don&#39;t finish one argument/chapter in full, I do often go from the end of one to the start of the next in the same reading! The chapters are built of many paragraphs. Each paragraph is full of short sentences - it really boils down to the essence of each thought but also leaves you space to fill in gaps or apply it to yourself. Stopping and thinking, chewing on ideas, feels good and natural with this style. This first reading I&#39;m reading for pleasure - next one will be to take ideas I want to explore deeper :).

I&#39;m only several chapters into this book, but I already think it&#39;s a generous gift to society. Having all the possible ways to approach life laid out before you helps you assess whether you like the approach to life you&#39;ve chosen so far. (Or do you want to &quot;try on&quot; a new way of approaching life?) As you read about each approach, you get clarity on what you value, what your North Star is. So, the book is a tool for greater self-knowledge, which I think is everything. (If you know yourself, you&#39;ll know how to live!) I can&#39;t wait to get to the &quot;weird conclusion&quot; at the end!
