<h1>AI usage</h1>
<p>
As of today, <time datetime="2025-01-05 11:11+1100">January 5, 2025</time>, here is how I’ve used generative AI/LLM tools.
</p>
<hr>

<p>
	I use <a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude.ai</a> mostly for research, the way I used to use a search engine before it returned mostly spam.
</p><p>
	I have <strong>never ever</strong> used AI to generate text instead of my own.
<strong>
	No emails.
	No sentences in my articles or books or even comments.
	Nothing pretending to be me.
</strong>
</p><p>
	I enjoy the challenge of writing myself.
	It’s organized thinking.
	It’s the <em>doing</em> I’m after, not having it done.
	See <a href="/being">my article “It’s about being, not having”</a> for more thoughts on this.
</p><p>
	I have used AI to generate programming functions for me, in SQL, Python, Go, or JavaScript, for educational purposes, which I’ve then adapted to include in my own code.
</p><p>
	While I’m writing, I often ask it the kinds of things I would ask a friend sitting next to me.
	Like, “What are examples of different ways of seeing life that are impossible to prove or disprove?”
	Or, “What professions most use a physical toolbox?”
</p><p>
	But again, the real point of this page is to let you know that <strong>nothing claiming to be written by me is written by an AI</strong>.
</p><p>
	If this changes in the future, I’ll update this page at this permanent URL:
	<a href="/ai">sive.rs/ai</a>
