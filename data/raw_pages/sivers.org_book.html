<h2><a href=/book/NegotiateAnything>You Can Negotiate Anything - by Herb Cohen</a></h2>
<small>Date read: 2023-08-02. How strongly I recommend it: <strong>10</strong>/10</small>
<p>Everything is negotiable. Challenge authority. You have the power in any situation. This is how to realize it and use it. A must-read classic from 1980 from a master negotiator. My notes here aren’t enough because the little book is filled with so many memorable stories — examples of great day-to-day moments of negotiation that will stick in your head for when you need them. (I especially loved the one about the power of the prisoner in solitary confinement.) So go buy and read the book. I’m giving it a 10/10 rating even though the second half of the book loses steam, because the first half is so crucial.

<p>Everyone should read this book of little essays about listening. It teaches your ears to pay more attention. It calls your attention to sounds you hadn’t noticed. It’s beautifully written, and makes your life better. I read it twice, 24 years ago, and reading it again this week, it was even better than I remembered.

<p>Wow. A profound little philosophy book from Japan, communicating the psychology of Alfred Adler - a rival of Freud. Told as a conversation between an angry student and a patient teacher. A little book so good that I rushed home from other activities to keep reading it, and finished in a day. A surprisingly fresh perspective on how to live. (The “disliked” part is not the point, so don’t let the title distract you.)

<p>Awesomely creative think-piece. 40 very short fictional stories about what happens when you die. The framework is inspiring for anyone: coming up with 40 different answers to any one question.

<p>I’ve read many books on parenting, but this one is the best. It’s genius. My top recommendation for everyone with a kid age 1-13. Its point is that children communicate through play. So, to reach them: play! Anything can be done through play: teaching, emotional connection, processing difficult situations, and even discipline can be made playful. Read the whole book instead of just my notes, since my little take-away ideas are just reminders of the spirit of the book. I re-read these notes almost every week to remind me how to be a great parent. My kid is always thankful (communicated through giddy laughter) when I remember and use this approach.

Are you a writer who doesn’t write, a painter who doesn’t paint, an entrepreneur who never starts a venture? Then you know what “Resistance” is. This book is about that. Read it.

<p>My most-recommended book for those pregnant or with a newborn. I was terrified and dreading having a baby until I read this and it got me excited. Written by a developmental molecular biologist, sharing results of confirmed studies about baby brain development, and what to do accordingly. Two big rules: (2) No screens at all until after age two. (1) A child needs to feel safe.

I first read it after 10 years of successfully running my company, and was still blown away and totally humbled by its wisdom. Re-reading it today, I&#39;m amazed how my view of business was completely changed by this one little book. See my notes for examples, but definitely read the book itself to get the real impact.

<p>Fascinating subject. Countries are made of stories. Kings didn’t need their subjects to agree, but nations do. So to build a nation, they need to make a story that helps people feel a shared identity, nationalism, and what distinguishes them from their neighbors. Back-creating a history. Founders of Israel did this brilliantly.

<p>So abstract. Maybe the most abstract book you’ll ever read. Compares “finite” games with rules and winners, versus “infinite” games without winners where we can play with the game itself. Is it about a job versus a calling? Religion versus spirituality? A story versus story-telling? Who knows. Thought-provoking if you can apply the metaphor to whatever concerns you.

<p>History of modern country of Israel, written by someone whose grandparents were part of its founding. Unapologetically pro-Israel, but also pro-Palestine and anti-Hamas. Well-written though the occasional unnecessary adjectives (“horrific” / “brave”) remind you that it’s clearly biased and personal. Despite that, it’s really a great history book, riveting throughout.

<p>Best philosophy of love relationships I’ve ever found. Like meditation teaches you that moods pass, this experienced marriage counselor says this applies to relationship communication as well. When angry or insecure, don’t vent, don’t share that. Let the feeling pass. Your anger doesn’t reveal some real truth. Everyone in a romantic relationship should read this.

<p>This 1992 book changed everything about my life. It’s my Bible. Most of my beliefs come from it. I read it many times at a formative age, but re-read it now 30 years later, taking notes. It’s not a perfect book. It’s too verbose and full of expired American references. But its core messages are the wisest, most effective life philosophy I’ve ever encountered. You choose how you feel. Your emotions come from you, not events or others. Doesn’t matter what’s true, but what empowers you. You adopted beliefs randomly from circumstance, but you can rewire your mind to believe whatever helps you be who you want to be. You have absolute control over your internal world. If you think, “I can’t help the way I feel”, you need this book.

<p>I’ve read this book three times since 1999, and gifted it many times to others. It’s changed the way I look at buildings. I read it again now because I’m building a new house. Its main idea is that all buildings are predictions, and all predictions are wrong, so design to make them easy to change. I think of it metaphorically in life: assuming my predictions about what I want will probably be wrong, so make my life easy to change. Get the paper book because the photos are crucial.

<p>The 2nd-best and most-radical book about great writing. It tells you to focus entirely on the sentence, an approach that was already my favorite, which is why I bought this book. It recommends you boldly eliminate transitions and conjunctions, split compound sentences, don&#39;t save your point for the end, and revise by deleting.  This is the first book I&#39;ve seen printed as one sentence per line — a way I&#39;ve been writing for many years, and now printed in my book “How to Live”.

<p>Amazing point: Would your belief in something stand up to the question, “Wanna bet?” If you had to gamble significant money on that belief, would you still feel 100% about it? Or maybe more honestly 60%? This creates healthy skepticism encouraging you to seek the best information instead of just defending your belief. Now objective accuracy wins instead of argument.

<p>Aimed at already-successful people. The personality traits that brought you to success (personal discipline, saying yes to everything, over-confidence) are the same traits that hold you back from going further! (Where you need to listen to lead, and don&#39;t let over-confidence make you over-commit.) Stinging counter-intuitive insights that hit very close to home for me. Great specific suggestions for how to improve.

<p>VERY interesting. Seth is moving from talking about business to talking about being an artist in the broad sense of anyone who creates (and ships!) something daring and new. I loved the distinction between the industrialist and the artist, as it helped me give a term for something I&#39;d experienced: not being able to relate at all to those who just want to grow business for business&#39; sake, whereas I always saw my business like a creative art project. The book stays very high-level, so don&#39;t look for “TO-DO” type tips.

<p>You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it. Two traits that consistently predict “positive outcomes” in life: intelligence and self-control. Most major problems, personal and social, center on failure of self-control. When people were asked about their failings, a lack of self-control was at the top of the list. So let&#39;s talk about self-control....

<p>The authors worked with the best athletes and executives for years, and found that the best ones knew how to push themselves, then recuperate, push, recuperate. Take this same approach to your emotional, mental, physical, and even spiritual life, and it&#39;s a powerful metaphor. Think of sprints, not marathons. Be fully in whatever you&#39;re in, then give time to recuperate. But push further each time, past your comfort zone, like a good exercise plan.

<p>Crucial distinction: People in a “fixed” mindset believe that you *are* great or flawed. People in a “growth” mindset believe your greatness (or flaws) are because of your actions. The fixed mindset is very harmful in every area of life (work, art, relationships, business, etc.) We get our initial mindset from our environment. When parents say, “You are great,” instead of ”You did great work,” they accidentally create the “fixed” mindset.

<p>Senior academic advisor to the Chinese Communist Party feels most political tensions come from a misunderstanding of China’s world view, hence the subtitle “demystifying to prevent global conflict”, and his intrinsic desire to explain. I love its insights and historical context, especially around “Respect-centered diplomacy” and how the CCP is structured.

If you haven&#39;t read much of AI yet, start with “Surviving AI” as an intro, then read this as a deep-dive. His perspective is amazingly thorough. Defining terminology was a great way to start. For example life is a “process that can retain its complexity and replicate”. Intelligence is the “ability to accomplish complex goals”. That keeps it broad enough to define future technology as alive and intelligent.

<p>Wow. So dense with wisdom that I wanted to highlight almost every paragraph. Instead, I skipped Part 1, about his background, because in the intro he recommends you skip it. I also skipped Part 3, about work principles, since they were all collaborative group-stuff, and I’m not working with anyone now. So here are my notes just from Part 2, “Life Principles”, which were so good I’ll probably re-read this book again next year. Caveat: it’s mostly so high-level — (“Decide what is true, then decide what to do about it.”) — that they’re more like koans to spark your own thoughts, instead of specific “do this” type advice.

<p>What are today&#39;s technologies inevitably going to lead to? Great predictions. Half of it was super-inspiring, painting a vision of the future that made me want to jump on it. Half felt like “well, duh, obviously!” maybe because I&#39;m already deep in it.

<p>After being quoted in many books, the guy who coined “deliberate practice”, and spent his career studying just that, finally writes his own take on it. But I&#39;ve already loved “The Talent Code”, “The Little Book of Talent”, “Moonwalking with Einstein”, “Talent is Overrated”, and “Little Bets”, which are all about this same field. So I didn&#39;t get much new out of it, but if you haven&#39;t already read those, maybe start here at the horse&#39;s mouth.

Using the most up-to-date techniques and insights, and a unique emphasis on getting the sounds correct first. It&#39;s not easy, but it&#39;s much more effective than any other program or guide.

<p>A great biography of the original essayist Michel de Montaigne from the 1500’s, it also explores his philosophical questions. I loved learning about Pyrrhonian Skepticism.

Some great ideas inside, especially the ones about family and healthy child-rearing. I just re-read it now, 22 years later, and it didn&#39;t hit me as hard as it did back then, maybe because I&#39;ve internalized its philosophies so completely.

<p>Written by an American who&#39;s lived in Germany for 20 years. Published in 2000, (and so probably written a couple years before), it&#39;s a little dated. The Berlin Wall was a fresh memory.

<p>I read this book right after reading a history of Israel, and I wish I would have found two equally-well-written books. Unfortunately this one was often an exhausting list of facts instead of a helpful narrative. The most interesting part, for me, was his claim that the founding stories of Israel were invented myth, which to me doesn’t delegitimize Israel as much as show the power of story.

<p>His first book, “Think and Grow Rich”, was a huge influence on me as a teenager.  I recently heard he wrote a major update to it shortly before he died, that some say is much better.  I guess my tastes have changed because though this book has good intentions, and might have made a big impact on me long ago, now I found it almost unreadably vague and had to stop.  The order in which we read books really does make a big difference.

I should have previewed the book before buying, because it’s a long-winded story of every person involved in the journey of discovery and development of CRISPR. What they look like, where they grew up, what they said, who they met and when, on and on and on. When I was done with the book, I watched a 15-minute Kurzgesagt video about CRISPR and learned better than I did from this long story-telling book.

<small>Date read: 2009-07-26. How strongly I recommend it: <strong>1</strong>/10</small>
<p>Well-intentioned book I couldn&#39;t stomach because of her awkwardly flowerly writing style. Also I&#39;ve read a lot about focus and flow, so this was mostly a repeat covered better in other books.

<p>It is interesting that this exists: a book written by a computer. The human authors created the questions. GPT-3 answered them. The humans published it only lightly edited. The content is supposed to be about the meaning of life, but the answers are extremely vague and uninteresting, no matter who “wrote” them. So, not worth reading, but worth knowing this exists and may become more common.

<p>I don’t remember who told me this book was great, but I assumed it would have wisdom. It did not. It was 900 pages of poorly-written story. The few moments I enjoyed led to nothing. It was wasted time. I regret reading it.

<p>I really wanted to like this book, but couldn&#39;t stomach the writing style. Instead of presenting his conclusions, you have to slog forever through his tales of how he went about his research, and how he felt about each step along the way to writing this book. I couldn&#39;t finish it.

<p>I give the basic idea a 9-out-of-10 rating: that we shouldn&#39;t declare and hold to a personality type (“I&#39;m an introvert! I&#39;m adventurous!”), but rather should adapt to the situation. Halfway through the book I gave up because I got the idea and didn&#39;t like the writing style.

<p>Cambodia&#39;s political history from 1978 to 2009 or so. Appalling, horrible, infuriating, disgusting, etc. I hated this book. I was hoping to learn more about Cambodia and its culture, but this only gives chapter after chapter detailing the horrible things the people in government did, and nothing else. No bright side. No other insights. Just horror.

<p>Yet another Rich Dad book shat out for the usual audience of those who don&#39;t read. Often so bad it hurts, but with the occasional useful sentence. He always seems to go out of his way to avoid giving any usable info - only generalities. Does he care? Is he trying to write great books? Are these things just machine-generated or something?

<p>One of the few books I&#39;ve actively disliked. Ever read the introduction to a book? Where they say “what you hold in your hands here is something that could change the world”, and blah blah blah? I kept reading, wondering when the introduction was going to be over. Over halfway through the book, I realized this was it: just broad general encouraging unuseful nothings for the entire book.
