</li><li>
	Download two different audiobook recordings of <strong><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=james+joyce+ulysses+audiobook">Ulysses by James Joyce</a></strong>. Length: 30 hours each.
</li><li>
	Download <strong><a href="https://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/joyce-s-ulysses">a course about Ulysses</a></strong>. Length: 12 hours.
</li><li>
	On the way to Kolkata, <strong>listen to the Odyssey</strong>, start to finish.
</li><li>
	Learn about Kolkata’s Bengali identity, languages, its colonial past as the capital of British India, the Writers’ Building, the Victoria Memorial, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Street_(Kolkata)">Boi Para</a>, and reputation as the literary capital of India.
</li><li>
	In <strong>Kolkata</strong>, walk around the city, listening to the Ulysses audiobook for <strong>ten hours per day, three days in a row</strong>, start to finish.
</li><li>
	Record (write or voice memo) all of your questions and observations.
	When done, ask everything to an expert or top-tier AI.

</li><li>
	While travelling from Kolkata to Istanbul, listen to the <strong>course</strong> about Ulysses, for more understanding and layers of meaning, preparing you to listen again.
</li><li>
	Learn about Istanbul’s past rulers, mixed identities and languages, juxtaposition of the sacred and commercial, and note its proximity to Aegean Sea of the Odyssey.
</li><li>
	In <strong>Istanbul, listen to the other recording of Ulysses</strong>, ten hours a day, three days in a row, start to finish, while walking around the vastly different neighborhoods, taking a ferry across the Bosphorus, noticing the similarities between Istanbul’s call to prayer and Dublin’s church bells.
	This time you’ll have a deeper appreciation of the book.
</li><li>

<p><em>
	(I haven’t done this yet, but plan to.
	I listened to <a href="https://www.emilyrcwilson.com/the-odyssey">that Odyssey audiobook</a> in two days of walking around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Meadow,_Oxford">Port Meadow, Oxford</a>, and have been yearning to listen again.)
