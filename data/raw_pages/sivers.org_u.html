<h1>What you will learn:</h1>

<h2>Personal effectiveness</h2>
<p>
“Useful Not True” is about <strong>reframing</strong>.
</p><p>
Success in anything starts with your <strong>perspective</strong> which affects your <strong>strategy</strong> — your <strong>actions</strong>.
</p><p>
Your <strong>first</strong> thought (“this is a disaster”) <strong>feels true</strong>, but it’s not the only perspective.
</p><p>
Your first thought is an <strong>obstacle</strong> you need to get past by realizing <strong>no thoughts are necessarily true</strong>.
</p><p>
<strong>After</strong> your initial impulse, consider <strong>other</strong> perspectives, then choose the thought that’s more <strong>useful</strong> to you — the one that makes you take <strong>effective actions</strong>.
</p>

<h2>Understanding others</h2>
<p>
<strong>
People share perspectives, not facts.
</strong>
They tell you how they see things.
</p><p>
Like someone <strong>across</strong> the world telling you the <strong>time</strong>.
Maybe it’s true for them, but <strong>not for you</strong>, and not for most other people.
</p><p>
Brains <strong>lie</strong> to their owners.
<strong>Nobody knows</strong> the real reasons why they do anything.
</p><p>
When someone says, <strong>“I believe…”</strong>, then whatever they say next is not a fact.
<strong>No</strong> beliefs are necessarily true.
</p><p>
Beliefs are perspectives.
Explanations are confabulated.
Obligations are wishes.
Rules are arbitrary.
They’re <strong>useful</strong>, but not necessarily <strong>true</strong>.
</p><p>
Knowing this gives you <strong>empathy</strong>, as you understand people’s <strong>incentives</strong> behind their beliefs.

<li><img src="/images/5stars.png"><blockquote>
A profoundly insightful and challenging take on the beliefs we hold and narratives we tell ourselves. <br><br>Some personal takeaways/‘ah ha!’ moments: <br><br>- Perspectives are not reality, they’re one person’s particular ‘take.’ A form of preference. We gravitate towards perspectives that serve our own interests. Therefore, question every strong opinion. Many are probably just a preference. <br><br>- Separate fact from interpretation. E.g. my colleague didn’t reply to my email vs. my colleague is ignoring me. Trying to attach meaning to situations/events is tiring and faulty. Stuff happens. Things are less about you than you think. <br><br>- Memories are comically faulty. Don’t rely on them.<br><br>- What is the point of belief if it doesn’t spur or influence some kind of action? Belief without action is like a seed never planted—it has potential, but never develops into something of consequence. <br><br>- Don’t be wedded to old beliefs at the expense of adopting new ones.  Different situations require different beliefs. If a belief helps you achieve a desired outcome, use it, but recognise that that same belief applied at a different time or to a different situation may not hold. Cast your net wide. Be flexible and in a constant state of reassessment.<br><br>- When we’re young, we think an intelligent person is someone with strong opinions and preferences. E.g. House from the TV series House or Daniel Plainview from There Will Be Blood. They’re intimidatingly strong-minded and “intelligent”. Everything is either right or wrong, and black or white. In reality, the smartest people are those that embrace ambiguity, and hold their opinions lightly. They have “intellectual humility.” <br><br>A read for anyone bold enough to look deeply within themselves.

Useful Not True is a transformative read that challenges how we perceive our beliefs and emotions.<br><br>Derek&#39;s concept of ‘Beliefs → Emotions → Actions’ was a revelation for me. Instead of trying to manage emotions through willpower, he shows how revising the stories we tell ourselves can swiftly change how we feel and act.<br><br>The engaging examples and stories not only kept me hooked but also resonated with my children as we listened together. His unique framing turned familiar ideas into powerful eureka moments.<br><br>This book is a practical guide to reframing our thoughts, and I can&#39;t recommend it highly enough.

I’ve read the book three times at this point, including the audio version. It’s such a simple idea that on a deep level we all know, I think. Now, though, I cannot help but see these useful (but not true) concepts everywhere. It shapes how I think about certain topics and how I debate them or discuss them with others. I found it to be an excellent tool in understanding where others are coming from and it resonates with them when we are discussing controversial issues like religion, god, or politics.

I&#39;m standing at the kitchen sink staring out the window across the driveway at the shop doors thinking about &quot;Useful Not True,&quot; Derek Sivers’ new book. I&#39;m lost in the artform of simple sentences, practical analogies, and clean &quot;reframing.&quot; I wish my shop was like that.<br><br>Sivers’ latest masterpiece is a modern equivalent of the Greek Stoic Philosopher Epictetus&#39; Enchiridion. Epictetus’ overall message was, only your opinion is within your control. Mercifully, “Useful Not True” uses contemporary, all-inclusive language and examples coalesced into single sentences and short paragraphs, all while addressing the myriad of perspectives that form our biases, and inevitably our lives.<br><br>On my fourth time through the book, “Different philosophies for different times in your life” frames my view. I glance out the window at my shop, its contents a cacophony of philosophies in the form of artwork and tools both neatly organized and madly strewn. Some so true in their prime, now outgrown and no longer useful. Backing away from the sink, I lay the book on the counter and head to the couch to write this review.<br><br>Buy “Useful Not True.” Read it. Read it again. Buy another copy. Or ten. Give it again and again.

Reading Useful Not True is like taking the Red Pill. After, you see the matrix. How everything works. How YOU work. Then, it&#39;s up to you what you do with this new perspective. You&#39;ll be empowered to shift your beliefs to suit what you need, when you need it.<br><br>It&#39;s powerful stuff, so be warned. Once you see what Derek is trying to show you, you cannot unsee it. And you won&#39;t want to.

Useful Not True is a life-changing book. This bit in particular hit home for me:<br><br>“On the other hand, there were many times where I thought I wanted something — in theory — then took the first step, and realized I was wrong. Taking action tests your thought in reality.”<br><br>Those two sentences saved me from months of misery. I remembered why I do certain things (because I love them and they make me happy) and why I don&#39;t do certain things (because I don&#39;t love them and they make me miserable).  But it&#39;s important to actually attempt the thing you think you want in theory - and then be able to remember it&#39;s okay to change your mind about them.<br><br>The whole concept of the book is powerful. But the other chapter I go back to again and again is “Fill Your Senses With Reality.” Every word in that passage, I believe, is useful. ☺

When I first crack open a new Derek Sivers book, I tremble with excitement…and I quake with fear.<br><br>I’m excited because I know I’m going to learn not just two or three completely new ideas, but forty-plus earthshaking original thoughts…even though there’s nothing new under the sun.<br><br>And I quake because I know those forty-plus new ideas will grab me by the throat and become a cyclone of unorthodox hyper-realities catapulting my little linear brain out of its cozy cognitive cubicle. Derek doesn’t just think outside the box. And he doesn’t merely live outside the box. Derek doesn’t have a box.<br><br>Derek dwells in the most fundamental of human elements: how to live; reality versus illusion; truth versus everything else. His work is like a crowbar to the art of thinking.<br><br>For many people, life is a zero sum game (ie, for me to win, you have to lose). But Derek knows that a fulfilling life embraces the concept of win-win. In fact, win-win is the only option. But since the collective human unconscious hasn’t learned that yet, this is what we have: the world in which we live. And, from what I’ve read, nobody deals with that reality better than Derek.<br><br>Derek is decades ahead of his time, possibly centuries. People might actually be talking about this Siversian way of thinking in the year 2525, if man is still alive. Derek’s work from the 21st century is like Newtonian physics for the psyche. Newton crunched the numbers. Derek is manipulating thoughts, ideas, and perspective to begin the “reframing” as he calls it. This reframing is all in the service of noble goals: a more productive use of your innate abilities; a more effective way to do your project; a mental device to provide what you need now; a simple mechanism to help you do what you want to do, or be who you want to be; or just to feel at peace.<br><br>Like most great books or themes or stories, the climactic portion of Derek’s book features a greatest hits of key points that rival any advice you’ll find anywhere, from the Bhagavad Gita to Pet Sounds. Here’s a sampler: Unclutter your computer from inputting new data and make a decision now. Take the first step immediately, without hesitation. Start momentum. Taking action tests your thought in reality. Invest yourself until your project comes to fruition…or until you decide to scrap the idea altogether.<br><br>Derek is a musician. He uses language like a songwriter: in clear cogent chords, in seamless staccato sections, in nuggets of nourishment for the soul, in oblique metaphysical ways like Lucy in the sky. He often writes in poetry, in blank verse like Shakespeare. Prose is frequently insufficient to convey Derek&#39;s message. Derek’s M.O. is transformation of the mind. It sounds hyperbolic, but he says it himself in the first line of his new book, Useful Not True: “This book is about reframing — changing how you think about something — and choosing a perspective that’s useful to you right now, whether or not it’s universally true.” Derek is clearly on to something, and the book is uniquely outstanding. His new world construct starts with, not merely doubt, but total deconstruction. A genuine tabula rasa.<br><br>I’ve never met Derek personally, but he became my life coach. I didn’t ask and he didn’t offer. It just happened…sort of by osmosis. If you yourself, somehow, someway, have connected with Derek, then you know it is a life-changing event. And it keeps getting better. It’s getting better all the time.

As I read Useful Not True, I was struck by how much the insights and wisdom within it reminded me of the most impactful book I&#39;ve ever read, The Tao Te Ching, by Laozi, the ancient Chinese philosopher. After I finished the book (which I thoroughly enjoyed), I concluded that Derek Sivers is the modern-day Laozi. Both Sivers and Laozi embrace simplicity and minimalism as the guiding principle in life. They also both advocate in their writings about the power of non-attachment and letting go.<br><br>Another common theme is the rejection of conventional wisdom and the challenging of the status quo. For example, I loved how in Useful Not True, just like the Tao Te Ching, a chapter will advocate for a seemingly contradictory and paradoxical approach to the chapter just before it - which you are left to make sense of according to your own values (far be it from Sivers or Laozi to tell you what makes sense for you).<br><br>Everything both Sivers and Laozi share is colored and enhanced by a focus on self-knowledge, inner wisdom, and the setting aside of the ego. The Tao Te Ching has held up for thousands of years, and I expect that the ideas in Useful Not True will be similarly long-lived!

I LOVE this book! As someone who left my corporate job a year ago to pursue a life of more freedom, this book helped me question my assumptions and encouraged me to rethink personal and societal norms.<br><br>One of my favorite takeaways is to question the narratives I create for myself: be skeptical of what I tell myself, let go of what isn&#39;t useful, and reframe my thinking to better serve my needs and create the life I want to live.<br><br>“Useful Not True” is a masterpiece. Derek Sivers writes succinctly and shares stories that are both engaging and easy to understand.<br><br>I&#39;ve read and reviewed this book a few times already, and each time I didn&#39;t want to put it down. This is a book I highly recommend. Derek&#39;s thoughtfulness and kindness shine through his writing and he exemplifies how to be less judgmental and more compassionate to others and to yourself.  Readers can get out of this what they want, whether it&#39;s a fresh perspective on ideas, or deep personal growth through reflection and journaling.<br><br>This book offers practical tools for those looking to transform their lives. It is an amazing resource that I&#39;ll review often.

When I read this book, I felt understood and seen on both intellectual and personal levels - a rare experience for someone who lives in her head, yet does not identify with nor believes in her own thoughts. <br><br>Useful Not True shone a light on those weird, lonely wonderings I&#39;ve found difficult to articulate to others:<br>* thoughts about the nature of faith and action<br>* man&#39;s need to trust and believe in something<br>* what a belief should be<br>* and how it ought to operate in one&#39;s life.

Useful Not True is long overdue. In few, well-chosen words, Derek’s book can help an open mind to see outside its default point of view, granting that person access to any number of other ways of seeing, thinking, feeling, and being.<br><br>The core idea —if the reader can accept it— offers a sort of mental and emotional resilience, the value of which is difficult (for me) to overstate. I say “if the reader can accept it”, because some may find it quite challenging to accept. In my experience, some of the most satisfying feelings follow a great challenge.<br><br>Useful Not True does not strike me as work of philosophy nor a self-help book, and yet it has changed how I think and in so doing has helped me a great deal. If it helps you, please share it widely and discuss it deeply.

Derek Sivers&#39; “Useful Not True” compellingly invites readers to question their deepest beliefs. As with his previous works, which I gift to all my friends, this book combines Derek&#39;s philosophical depth with his practical wisdom.<br><br>This is my truth: This book is a useful must-read for anyone open to reframing the boundaries of truth and utility in daily thought.

&quot;Useful Not True&quot; delivers a powerful, life-changing message, with each chapter perfectly written and organized into sections that flow logically. It emphasizes how our beliefs shape our emotions, our view of the world, and our feelings about the future. With this understanding, we can start taking meaningful actions that bring us closer to our goals.<br><br>Derek masterfully shows how shifting our mindset can have a transformative impact. Beliefs create emotions, and emotions create actions—so we should choose beliefs that drive the actions we want to take. The book explores this concept by offering practical strategies, showing that different philosophies can be applied to different stages of our lives.<br><br>In continuation of &quot;How to Live,&quot; this book takes a step further, demonstrating how you can reframe the narrative of your life. Even in difficult moments, it provides tools to rediscover the beauty in life, reminding us that reality is far more fluid than we often admit.<br><br>It’s a book that not only challenges you to question everything but also makes you love the process of doing so. Everything is presented in a clear, practical way, making its life-changing potential feel both accessible and empowering.

Why did I pick up this book in the first place?<br><br>Well, it comes down to two things: First, I read “How to Live”. After finishing it, I reached out to Derek to let him know how much I enjoyed it, and we ended up having a great personal conversation. Then, in the spring of 2024, Derek shared an early version of his new book with me.<br><br>Given how “How to Live” gave me plenty to reflect on during a pivotal time in my life, I couldn’t resist diving into “Useful Not True”—even though I wasn’t initially planning to. Here’s my take on it:<br><br>We often think that what matters most in life is truth, but finding the truth isn’t easy. People can mislead us, and we often believe things without questioning them. Sometimes, it’s just nonsense, and we don’t even realize it because we don’t take the time to think for ourselves. That’s why the phrase “nullius in verba,” or “take no one’s word for it,” is so important. We should always question what we hear and seek the truth for ourselves.<br><br>Derek’s book is full of questions and short stories that challenge you. If you let them, they push you out of your comfort zone and prompt you to think more critically. It encourages you to reflect and take responsibility for your thoughts, showing that you have the power to replace unhelpful beliefs with better ones.<br><br>In that sense, “Useful Not True” is an excellent guide for uncovering misconceptions and thinking for yourself.

Reading “USEFUL NOT TRUE” was a game-changer for me. It struck me that so much of what we stress about or chase after isn’t real, it’s just noise we’ve been conditioned to care about. The things that actually matter are few and incredibly precious. When I realized that, it was like a weight lifted. I get to choose how I perceive my life and decide what to optimize for. It’s empowering to know that life is a game, and I get to define the scorecard. Now, I focus on what truly matters to me, and everything else? It’s just made up. Remember: All uniforms are costumes.

I gave this book a lot of thoughts. It’s about people and space. Your boundary is bound by the space of truth traffic.<br><br>Each chapter gives hint on how someone’s truth (if smashed to you) could make or break your decision or even life. Then it’s hard to assert your truth with another mind. Then when you realize you even have to rehabilitate yourself from what has been brainwashed to you since childhood. You could keep quiet or grin about it all.<br><br>Finally, something convincing about who is true in this world has been written. It shines bright and makes me feel good learning about it. I’ll stick to it and read whenever I feel displaced.  Discernment is the key. Truth is very personal.

Derek Sivers is my favorite business writer and USEFUL NOT TRUE is his most important work.<br><br>It&#39;s about how we construct reality — sometimes willfully but often unthinkingly — and what we can do to approach life in ways that are more likely to be helpful to us and to others.<br>It’s about redoing how you see and act.<br>I&#39;ve read or listened to it five times, and the impact it&#39;s had on me is substantial.<br><br>In fact, the first time I read it was right before bed, and I think it triggered a semi-nightmare.

1. This book helped me have deeper conversations with people. Before I used to debate and argue over my views. Now I can see why people &quot;choose&quot; to think a certain way. Anytime there&#39;s a difference of opinion I ask myself &quot;why does the other person find this belief useful?&quot; versus &quot;how can they believe this?&quot;. Once you start thinking &quot;no beliefs are true, not even yours&quot; you start talking less and listening more.<br><br>2. I was stuck in a relationship I had conflicting thoughts about and this book helped me build up the courage to get out of it. A month after reading it I used it to separate out the &quot;facts&quot; from my own beliefs and make up a list of &quot;useful beliefs to pick assuming the way to be happy is to break up&quot; (which is actually really hard, because your limbic brain keeps fighting to convince you &#39;the way to be happy is to stay in the relationship&#39;).<br><br>3. Many times after breaking up I felt sad and went into my journal to understand why I found it &quot;useful&quot; to feel sad after a break-up. My personal conclusion was - it is useful for humans to feel pain after a break-up so they stay together next time, because staying together is useful for our species as-a-whole to ensure survival. Of course, even this is just a belief, but it is good enough for me to deal with my break-up

The concept of choosing beliefs based on their usefulness rather than absolute truth has been transformative.

Derek Sivers’ Useful Not True kicks off with a wild premise: almost nothing people say, think, believe, or remember is entirely and objectively true. Through a series of funny and engaging anecdotes, Sivers shows that reality is way more fluid than we like to admit.<br><br>Sivers reframes truth as just another tool in your mental toolbox, and suggests a shift in focus from seeking objective truth to embracing perspective truth… that is, to embrace the ideas that are helpful, even if they’re not objectively true. If an idea motivates you, calms you down, or pushes you toward action, does it really matter if it’s true?<br><br>Sivers’ tone is casual and fun, like having a deep, late-night conversation with a friend who’s also a life coach and a stand-up comic. He’s quick to poke holes in convention, while reminding you that it’s not about tearing everything down but about choosing the perspectives that serve you best.<br><br>Useful Not True is a guide to embracing uncertainty and reframing your thoughts in ways that make life better, not necessarily more accurate. It’s the kind of book that makes you question everything - and love the fact that you did.

&quot;Useful Not True&quot; is a trojan horse: Sivers embeds deep metarational ideas into an enjoyable, accessible, and friendly read. It&#39;s an exploration into the nature of truth and belief. Truth is nebulous and slips through our hands, and often isn&#39;t even all that useful. What we consider &quot;true&quot; is merely a perspective, shaped by our experiences and context. Instead of chasing absolute truth, we should adopt beliefs that are useful for our current situation and goals. Context matters.<br><br>This approach might sound like relativism, but it&#39;s far more nuanced. Sivers isn&#39;t saying truth doesn&#39;t exist, just that it&#39;s often less relevant and emptier than we think. He provides concrete strategies for reframing thoughts and questioning inherited beliefs, illustrating complex ideas through vivid analogies and personal anecdotes.<br><br>Are the ideas new? Not really, yet &quot;Useful Not True&quot; was unexpectedly profound for me. It&#39;s not just about personal growth, it&#39;s not self-help. Instead, it offers a more nuanced, context-aware way of navigating the world that opens us to greater empathy, creativity, and adaptability. I&#39;ve encountered this — both propositionally and perspectively — but something about Derek&#39;s playful voice made it even more real. It&#39;s brilliant and transformative.

In Useful Not True, Sivers pokes fun at perspective, using succinct stories, revealing how our beliefs are inherently processed with biases and personal motives. A great book for confronting our perception of reality and our judgments, understanding that nothing is definitive and no truth is perfect. I appreciated the underlying theme that it’s okay to adopt beliefs that are ‘useful, not true’ if they inspire positive consequences. Ultimately, a great reminder to reframe our perspective and find what serves us.

“Useful, Not True” is all about opening our minds to the choices that are available to us. There are always choices, and we are in fact always making choices about how to interpret what is happening in the “real” world around us. <br><br>The world is indeed real, but I put ”real” in quotes because this book highlights how so much of what we think about the world is not real in an absolute sense, it is not absolutely true.<br><br>For example, say I broke my left hand in a way that cannot be surgically repaired back to complete functionality.  “I have suffered a hand injury” is true.  “My career as a musician is over” may not be true. Is it useful?  “My career as a concert violinist is over” may be close to truth, and it may in fact be useful.  “Maybe I should explore new career opportunities as a composer, conductor, or producer” is close to truth, I think, or at the very least it’s highly useful.<br><br>So the book is like that, it’s about how we frame and reframe our lives.

Useful Not True is an adventurous book. This time Derek makes a clear point: our reality is subjective and we almost never really know the objective truth - even when we think we do.

I liked the book. It helped me to appreciate the universe of thinking patterns that are &quot;not true&quot; as defined in the book, i.e., not &quot;absolutely, necessarily, objectively true.&quot; This universe of &quot;not true&quot; covers what other people say and what we say, what we say and what we think, what is happening to us now and what has happened to us in the past, and even &quot;incontrovertible&quot; laws. The essence of the argument is that everything depends on the point of view and on the interpretation.<br><br>One way to use the knowledge of the &quot;not true&quot; is to become permanently skeptical of yourself and others. But this is unhealthy and impractical. A better way suggested by Derek is to reframe various circumstances in a positive, for you, way. Even tragic parts of life can be viewed as &quot;useful&quot; even if &quot;not true.&quot; Even death (last section of the book).<br><br>The book includes a part with several sections of practical advice on &quot;useful&quot; attitudes. For me, the most helpful section was on internalizing them in a private journal. I already keep a decision journal in which I write intermittently when I face important decisions. Derek&#39;s book adds a new aspect to my analysis to interrogate my goals, the information I use, and the decision framework itself to find the most useful approach. The outcome will be &quot;useful&quot; even if not &quot;absolutely, necessarily, objectively true.&quot;

Another one of those brilliantly concise books – no sentences wasted. Like Derek has done before, he encircles one single idea and views it from every possible angle. I liked the edginess of this particular idea: The notion that it’s not as important if a statement is true compared to how useful that statement is and which actions it inspires in us. <br><br>It’s an important aspect of this to acknowledge how our brains sometimes trick us into internalizing a false belief or giving a destructive meaning to something which actually doesn’t need to have that. Only if we keep questioning ourselves and, by extension, the current widely accepted facts by putting them against a measure of usefulness, can we reach a more fulfilling way of life. <br><br>The book is empowering and inspiring. Sivers is driving the point home with a variety of colorful examples.

As someone who is prone to living in my head too much, I have been actively working on being present, of experiencing life with all my senses, thoughts included, on what is at hand. Recalling that the future technically doesn&#39;t exist is such a useful reminder for me to come back to the now.<br><br>I cannot fully express the beauty of “USEFUL NOT TRUE” because like art, the true magic of appreciating a book such as this, lies in the individual&#39;s process of reading it, ruminating on it and letting the words and ideas sink into one&#39;s subconsciousness as you interact with it. Definitely a book to savour time and again.

Utility beats correctness in daily life.  I&#39;ve spend too much time trying to get a close to the truth as possible. Or in other words to get it as correct as possible.

In the book “Useful Not True”, Derek invites us to notice that there are very few things that are 100% real. The past is not real - our memories of it are imprecise and rewritten for convenience. Our thoughts are not real - we invent them to justify what we are feeling or have already decided or done. Everything created by man is arbitrary (government, business, family, friends, partner, and a long etcetera). But - and here lies the simple beauty of this philosophy - we can choose what is useful even if it is not true. Noticing that these rules and conventions are arbitrary gives us the power to avoid, alter, or modify them.<br><br>These rules and conventions are like a costume we wear to be accepted in fear of looking odd - but in reality, no one is looking at us. It’s like the story of “The Emperor’s New Clothes” but completely the opposite - no one is really paying attention and worried about the disguise you wear. And if all clothing is arbitrary and a disguise, what does it matter to try on another costume, flamboyant and colorful, if it serves a better purpose?<br><br>We are prisoners of customs and the stories we tell ourselves. For example, I thought I couldn’t solve the Rubik’s cube because I had tried a few times without success - so I didn’t even bother to find out what I needed to solve it. I closed myself off in a false certainty until by chance someone burst that bubble with a “it’s a mechanical skill, anyone can learn it.” And indeed, once I knew I could, I learned how. I couldn’t before, as I had denied myself that possibility due to a rule I invented for myself.<br><br>Doubting your certainties and the rules that surround you, allows you to rethink what you want and can achieve.

&quot;Useful, Not True&quot; is the philosophy book for today. It emphasizes that life is not about being right all the time, it&#39;s about choosing the option that works. It&#39;s about being flexible and being willing to choose again when we find that our past choices no longer serve us. Life is too short to spend it fighting for the choices that a past version of myself made that no longer make sense in today&#39;s context.

This book has been both useful and helpful. It challenges the fundamentals assumptions we make about all sort of things. Putting a question mark at the end of what we&#39;ve always considered to be true and unquestionable can be deeply freeing and liberating. I love Derek&#39;s willingness to inquire and go beyond superficial appearances.

Once again I believe he has struck at the core at what it means to live our best lives as human beings.

But I am not a person of faith based upon indoctrination but rather based upon relationship. <br><br>Usefulness is a two pronged entity for me. One having to do with the personal and the other having to do with its effect on  collective society.  For instance I personally have a compulsive need to fulfill a perceived need in others.

Perhaps there is a measure of truth in a usefulness such as this.

One of the first things that comes to mind is that I really enjoyed the distinction he draws between what we believe to be true and what is actually true. The exercise of determining if something I believe is actually true on an objective, fundamental level is a powerful introspective activity that deepens my focus (regardless of if it is or isn&#39;t true) and triggers a constructive reality check.

My two favorite ideas from the book after looking at my highlights:<br><br>1.  “Nothing has inherent meaning. Whatever meaning you project into it is your own.” We have this nasty habit of thinking and framing in terms of labels and ideas that are not useful. Made me think of Anthony de Mello’s book Awareness.<br><br>2.  The idea that a decision or a choice becomes the best choice after you choose it, because you’re now down that path – “no choice is the best in itself.” You make it the best choice and align with it. You talked about this idea on a podcast episode of Infinite Loops and I remember having an epiphany when that happened.<br><br>Thanks for writing and sharing again your useful ways of thinking!
