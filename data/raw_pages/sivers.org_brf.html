	Imagine you’re a ghost.
<br>
	You drift through the world but nobody sees you.
<br>
	You’re disconnected.
</p><p>
	Then one day, after years of being invisible, someone sees you!
<br>
	You get to know each other, and become friends.
<br>
	Through that one connection, your life begins.
</p><p>
	I have few memories of childhood, maybe because it felt like nobody saw me.
<br>
<strong>
	My life began at age 12 when I met my first best friend.
</strong>
<br>
	We talked hours a day for years, sharing all of our thoughts — comparing experiences and emotions.
</p><p>
	The seed of who I am might have been there before.
<br>
	But the interaction with a friend made it sprout.
<br>
	That’s when this tree began.
<br>
	Conception versus birth.
</p><p>
	If a tree falls and no one hears it, did it make a sound?
<br>
	When your thoughts are acknowledged and reflected back through another, it’s like reverb.
<br>
	It’s validation.
</p><p>
	It’s confusing to be mis-acknowledged.
<br>
	A tree falls and the reverb comes back as a duck quack.
<br>
	Someone seems to hear you, but always misunderstands.
<br>
	It screws with your identity.
<br>
	(Am I actually a duck?)
</p><p>
	I recently knew someone that would listen but never respond.
<br>
	Thoughts went in but never came out.
<br>
	I loved her but was lonely around her.
</p><p>
	I’m so thankful for dear friends that play catch with me — tossing thoughts back and forth.
<br>
	Mutual reverb, growing our sprouts, demonstrably seen and connected.
