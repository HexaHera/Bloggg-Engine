Updated June 23rd, 2025, from my home in New Zealand, where a cold and rainy winter has begun.

<h2>reading again</h2>
<p>
Using a <a href="https://shop.boox.com/collections/all/products/go6">Boox Go 6</a> EPUB reader, I’m reading while exercising, reading in bed in the morning until the house warms up, reading while my kid plays with friends in the forest, and after a long hike when my legs hurt, laying on the couch.
Feels great to be excited to <a href="/book">read</a> again.
Not sure why I wasn’t for a while.

<h2>learning Chinese</h2>
<p>
After three trips to China in one year, I’m enamored.
I love being there, and want to live in Shanghai ASAP.
I’m spending hours a day learning Chinese using <a href="https://skritter.com">Skritter</a>, <a href="https://wenlin.com">Wenlin</a>, <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net">Anki</a>, <a href="https://michelthomas.com/landing-page/mt-mandarin/">Michel Thomas</a>, <a href="https://www.pimsleur.com/learn-chinese-mandarin/">Pimsleur</a>, and more under the advice of <a href="https://www.hackingchinese.com">Olle Linge from Hacking Chinese</a>.
It will take years to get to fluency, but I’m committed.
I’ve memorized how to read and write (and type!) these 504 characters and components:

<h2>Mac</h2>
<p>
I prefer <a href="/openbsd">OpenBSD</a> or at least <a href="https://voidlinux.org">Linux</a> but typing Chinese is so much better on a Mac that I reluctantly swapped my 10-year-old trusty desktop for the cheapest Mac Mini M4.
I miss the <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/">Ratpoison</a> window manager the most, but it’s nice to be able to use apps like WeChat, WhatsApp, Wenlin, <a href="https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper">MacWhisper</a>, <a href="https://openmtp.ganeshrvel.com">OpenMTP</a> and Anki that were impossible or difficult on BSD/Linux.

<h2>knee-focused exercise</h2>
<p>
After tearing the cartilage in my knee last year, cycling improved it enough to exercise again.
So I’m working with <a href="https://www.atgonlinecoaching.com">ATG</a> (“knees over toes”) to re-strengthen.

<h2>boy in high school</h2>
<p>
My son is in his first year of high school, and is so wonderfully insightful, philosophical, talkative, and creative.
We just talk talk talk talk like 20+ hours a week, often while walking through forests.

<h2>rats are wonderful</h2>
<p>
The pet <a href="/rats">rats</a> are adorable little hand-warmers.
