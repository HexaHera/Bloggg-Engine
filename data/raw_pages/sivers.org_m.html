<h1>Your Music and People</h1>
<p><strong><em>creative and considerate fame</em></strong></p>
</header>

<p><strong>
a philosophy of getting your work to the world by being creative, considerate, resourceful, and connected
</strong></p>

<h3>Every creator has the same problems with marketing.</h3>
<ul>
<li>How do you <strong>call attention</strong> to your work?</li>
<li>How do you get your creations into people’s <strong>minds and hearts</strong>?</li>
<li>How do you get fans to <strong>tell their friends</strong>?</li>
<li>How do you <strong>charge money</strong> for your labor of love?</li>
<li>How do you get the <strong>media</strong> to <strong>help</strong>?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Derek Sivers was a professional musician before he started a music distribution company that helped 150,000 musicians sell their music to over four million people. So after years of living the problems, he was able to learn the solutions.
</p><p>
“Your Music and People” shares a successful philosophy of <strong>getting your work to the world by being creative, considerate, resourceful, and connected</strong>.
</p>

<h3>It’s not just for musicians.</h3>
<p>
Though it uses music as the example, it is meant for any creator trying to reach people.
Early readers called it one of the best books ever written on business marketing.
</p><p>
Example points include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Business is <strong>just as creative</strong> as music.</li>
<li>Marketing is an <strong>extension of your art.</strong></li>
<li>Marketing means <strong>being considerate.</strong> Focus on others.</li>
<li>Being weird is considerate.</li>
<li>People skills are counterintuitive. To be helped, be helpful.</li>
<li><strong>Persistence is polite.</strong></li>
<li>Call the destination and ask for directions.</li>
<li>Get specific about what you want.</li>
<li>Be extreme and sharply defined. <strong>Proudly exclude most people.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Money is just a neutral representation of value.</strong> Be valuable to others — not just yourself. People like to pay.</li>
<li>Nobody knows the future, so <strong>focus on what doesn’t change.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
The first 10,000 early buyers of “Your Music and People” have posted hundreds of 5-star reviews at <a href="/m">sive.rs/m</a> — but it is now being released to a wider audience.

<h2>Editorial Reviews</h2>

<p>“This is one of the top two marketing books I own (and I've read hundreds of them).”<br>
<small>— Dan Sanchez, author of I Want to Be a Marketer When I Grow Up</small></p>

<p>“I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!! As a musician who finds spammy-sleazy-promotion repugnant, it was so refreshing to find an alternative perspective whereby marketing is ethical, creative, and be just as much an artform and service as the art itself. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Buy this book and bathe in its honesty, fun, and pragmatism.”<br>
<small>— Úna Ní Fhlannagáin, award-winning Irish harpist</small></p>

<p>“I’m not a musician. I’m a lawyer. I planned on sending this to my daughter, but before I mailed it, I skimmed a couple pages. I ended up reading the whole thing and taking a ton of notes. The lessons/concepts apply to what I do. It was unexpected, and very cool. Few lawyers have read this book, so I feel like I gained some new and rare insights. (I spend a lot of time looking for overlooked advantages in unexpected places.) I’ll be ordering some extra copies to give to my students.”<br>
<small>— Charlie Price</small></p>

<p>“I work in the music business, which is notorious for constantly changing. This book, however, will always be relevant! It explores the essential, eternal principles underlying the interaction between music and its listeners. It's a must-read advantage for anyone interested in music and how to share it, as well as for anyone interested in sharing any other form of creativity. Highly recommend!”<br>
<small>— Manny Vallarino</small></p>

<p>“I'm actually not a musician, but I do run my own business, and these tools apply to anyone seeking to understand how to effectively put themselves out there both honorably and confidently. If all people in business were considering these tools, not only would our unique gifts be more broadly shared, but our ways of sharing and earning income from that sharing would change the world for the better.”<br>
<small>— Kim Marie, coach, mentor</small></p>

<p>“This book is amazing. You start thinking it's going to be about the music industry, but it instead teaches you how to be a more creative artist when it comes to marketing, management, and taking care of your fans. There are big philosophies in this book that will shift your framework, as well as small tricks that you can apply right away. Definitely the best and most impactful book I've read on the music business.”<br>
<small>— Banner Driskell, film-maker, musician</small></p>

<p>“This is a book full of generosity, and describes marketing for what it is: creating curiosity and delight for your audience, caring for your fans, creating loyalty to and from your people, and doing your best work because you care.”<br>
<small>— Daniel Ciocîrlan, developer and best-selling instructor</small></p>

<p>“The unorthodox guide to creative success. Short anecdotes, parables, and concepts that help readers ask important questions about their creative journeys. Everything is simple, pragmatic, and straightforward, but also slightly unintuitive. It's a collection of the most uncommon expressions of common sense for creative people. I recommend it to anyone trying to carve out their niche in any creative field.”<br>
<small>— Erik Sabol</small></p>

<p>“Crucial insights for how to chart your own path in the world of business. Each page has actionable advice, which sometimes goes against the prevailing wisdom. Makes you question some of your closest-held beliefs about how business and marketing works. Anyone who is in business should read this book. Its genius-level advice coming from a guy who's actually done it, and knows what he's talking about.”<br>
<small>— Tom Stein, professor, Berklee College Of Music</small></p>

<p>“This is the first time I have stumbled upon someone who talks about business and growth in a different way. His ideas spring from deleting all the noise, and focusing on what truly maters. A noise-free, stoic minimalist, who can make life simple for you. If you need advice from a mature, experienced and caring person, who enjoys cutting off the fluff, this is the book to read.”<br>
<small>— Slavko Desik, international entrepreneur</small></p>

<p>“I'm not a musician. The last time I picked up a guitar was 20 years ago. But this is one of the best books on marketing I've ever read. Lots of digestible ideas and tips. Strategies, tactics, and habits that you can steal straight away. I listen to the audio book every couple of months (which is fantastic in itself!). Most engaging and human book on marketing that I've ever read!”<br>
<small>— Stefan Wilkerson, author, entrepreneur</small></p>

<p>“The best book I've read on business, much less the music business. I'm sure I will refer to it the rest of my life, whatever I'm doing. I find the ideas to be semi-radical, yet embracing. I feel I want to live up to it, yet am not fully sure what that would entail. Yet, I have already gotten so much from it that I am already using. I have bought extra copies so I can give them to my friends.”<br>
<small>— Marc Coleman, musician, author</small></p>

<p>“This book was a life changer for me. When it showed me that people in the music biz are people just like you and me, I had a mind shift. I learned so much from this little book. Many of the pages are dogeared and parts are underlined. It's a game changer for sure!”<br>
<small>— Lisa Yves Winner, jazz musician</small></p>

<p>“I have given out 3 copies of this book, and all responded to say how important and helpful it was to them. No other gifted book has returned such heartfelt appreciation.”<br>
<small>— Michael Kumm, engineer</small></p>

YOUR MUSIC AND PEOPLE is the unorthodox guide to creative success.

It&#39;s a collection of the most uncommon expressions of common sense for creative people, and I&#39;d recommend it to anyone trying to carve out their niche in *any* creative field -- music or otherwise.

“Your Music and People” was supposed to be for my daughter, who’s studying music in college. I had planned on sending it to her this morning. But before I mailed it, I skimmed a couple pages. I ended up reading the whole thing — and taking a ton of notes.<br><br>I’m not a musician. I’m a lawyer. Still, I found that 70% of the lessons/concepts — with a tweak here and there — apply to what I do. Especially the stuff in the Creative, Considerate, and People sections. It was unexpected, and very cool. My hunch is that few lawyers have read this book, so I feel like I gained some new and rare insights. (I spend a lot of time looking for overlooked advantages in unexpected places.) Advantages aside, I’ll be ordering some extra copies to give to my students.<br><br>I read a lot. And every once in a while — not often, but occasionally — I come across something that stops me in my tracks. Some phrase or line that makes me look up, shake my head, and think to myself, “F*ck … I wish I had learned that 20 years ago.” It’s like the advice or idea is so good that I actually get pissed that I hadn’t read it sooner. It’s a funny sensation, kind of a low-level dread. Humbling, but with some optimism tossed in. It reminds me that whatever we’re doing to get good at something — and whatever we think “good” actually is — well, we better think again, because the horizon is infinite. So pack your bags and buckle up, because it’s a long, long ride. Anyway, I had several of those moments reading Your Music and People, which probably wasn’t even written for someone like me. That’s a great job.

&quot;Your Music and People&quot; is a compilation of insight and wisdom on how to become successful as a musician and in the music business. All of the ideas and anecdotes come from the author&#39;s life experience. The chapters are presented as &quot;pearls&quot; of advice that one can apply to any industry that requires self-promotion.<br><br>I especially enjoyed the guitar chords that were played before each new chapter was announced.  I found myself attempting to identify each chord and wondering if there was a connection to the chapter that followed.<br><br>Sivers is a minimalist and it&#39;s evident in his writing; it&#39;s poetic. His words are chosen carefully in order to get his ideas across in the most efficient way possible, with the least amount of words possible.<br><br>The audiobook is read by the author. Derek&#39;s voice is soothing to listen to and his reading is clear. He reads with conviction and passion. I can only give his books my highest recommendation.

Ever since I&#39;ve read &quot;Anything you want&quot;, and discovered Derek&#39;s blog, I fell in love with his writing. I have built a SaaS product, a gig-economy platform and several niche websites, and this was the first time I have stumbled upon someone who talks about business and growth in a different way.<br><br>His ideas spring from deleting all the noise, and focusing on what truly maters - in both personal and professional life. If my meditation mentor and my therapist had a baby, and she grew up to make huge success in business, her voice would be that of Derek. A noise-free, stoic minimalist, who can make life simple for you. And mind you - simple doesn&#39;t imply less fun - quite the contrary. <br><br>If the business aspect and the promotion of your product gave you a bad taste in your mouth for years, this is the book to read. If you love to create, but hate, or doesn&#39;t know how to put your work in front of others, this is the book to read.<br><br>Some lessons I have learned from years and years of trial and error, but this book articulates them in way that resonates profoundly. It motivates, inspires, and gives dozens of ways to approach the process. Derek recognizes that as in life, the same holds true in business - there is not a single way forward. There are many answers to one question, and it is indeed possible to enjoy the &quot;problem&quot; that you are trying to solve.<br><br>If you need advice from a mature, experienced and caring person, who enjoys cutting off the fluff, this is the book to read.<br><br>Thinking about it, this is the book you never knew you needed.<br><br>The editing is superb, the chapters are short and enjoyable, and the audio version is impeccable. It&#39;s like listening to your favorite album.<br><br>P.S. I most highly recommend &quot;Anything you want&quot;, as a complimentary reading. Equipped with both, you will never think about entrepreneurship in the same way.<br><br>Slavko Desik

I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!

Sivers is the King Midas of creativity and ideas. Sivers keeps turning ideas into golden nuggets of inspiration. This book is yet another shining example of his ongoing mindset of challenging the status quo of still minds needing that spark to explode all over the place. This book challenges me and asks me to think even further out of the box than I thought I already did. An incredibly quotable book with lines like these strewn about like little diamonds in the rough sand of what-to-do  if I get stuck: “Whenever you’re feeling uninspired or unmotivated, use creative restrictions to set you free.” I recommend getting inspired by reading this book to push on further in getting farther than you thought possible in the world of music and creativity.

Fantastic, game changing book. So many ideas and reminders of things that alot of us already know but have forgotten. Its remarkable how some of the simplest, basic social concepts slipped had by me. Derek reminded me with this book and re-opened my eyes to things I had drifted from. Thankful for finding his ideas and employing them frequently.

Music and People is the best book I&#39;ve read on business, much less the music business.<br><br>I find it hard to put into words what it has done for me, as I&#39;m still absorbing it. I&#39;m sure I will refer to it the rest of my life, whatever I&#39;m doing.<br><br>I find the ideas to be semi-radical, yet embracing. I feel I want to live up to it, yet am not fully sure what that would entail. Yet, I have already gotten so much from it that I am already using.<br><br>I have bought extra copies so I can give them to my friends. For example, a guy who has been around long enough for the Replacements to open for the band he was in now has this book.<br><br>The world is a better place because of the eddies of Derek&#39;s thoughts as they swirl through the cosmos.

Derek&#39;s book is full of musings about the music industry with crucial insights for how to chart your own path in the world of business. Each page has actionable advice, which sometimes goes against the prevailing wisdom. Reading him should make you question some of your closest-held beliefs about how business and marketing works. Anyone who is in business should read this book. It&#39;s genius-level advice coming from a guy who&#39;s actually done it, and knows what he&#39;s talking about.

This book was a life changer for me.  When Derek showed me that people in the music biz are people just like you and me, I had a mind shift.  I learned so much from this little book.  Many of the pages are dogeared and parts are underlined.  It&#39;s a game changer for sure!

This book has become a bible for me of sorts. Got it on audiobook, which was a very quick and easy listen, and have listened to it multiple times since. As an artist who loves his craft, I&#39;ve always been intent on writing and not so much on actually promoting myself or selling my work. This book will totally change your mindset on that. And I think the best part about it is that it applies to any artist-- not just musicians. I&#39;m a screenwriter and got a ton of insight from it. Highly recommend it.

Chapters I like the most... 7, 19, 28, 44, 45, 47, 87... <br><br>Make mystery in and around your music.<br>Be helpful to others in any kind of way, your time to receive help will come too.<br>Don&#39;t bother looking for new opportunities until you can show some level of success in what you do. <br>Sometimes, a simple thing like &quot;treating someone a pizza&quot; can change your future! <br>Stop complaining, but rather try to make a difference yourself in making things better. <br>Describe your art in a memorable way. <br>Get advice but, follow the advice that excites you.<br><br>Nice work Derek!

Especially if you are an artist of any kind, this is the only book I&#39;ve ever read (and the only one I&#39;ll ever need) that has walked me through the principles of creative and considerate ways to get my work seen by the right people.  For musicians, actors, writers, directors, I especially recommend this book so that you can be empowered to be as creative with the business side as you are in creating your art.  If you&#39;re serious about actually making a living as an artist, this book helps you get in the drivers seat of your career instead of sitting around waiting to be discovered.

Music is the title of the book, however, it could also say, your painting, or your basket weaving or printmaking. The book can be summed up in one sentence, from page 7. &quot;The way you present your art, and what people know about it, completely changes how they perceive it.&quot; <br>The rest of the book, until page 132 is full of stories from Derek&#39;s life on how he pursued his music.

I wasn’t initially planning on reading the book because I know nothing about music but the table of contents really intrigued me and I&#39;ve always loved Derek&#39;s style of writing, so I bought it. Also, I suspect I’m addicted to books :)<br><br>Here are my general and specific comments:<br><br>General:<br><br>Overall, I loved the book. There is no-fluff and the book has bite-sized chapters, every chapter has only the crux, nothing more, nothing less-- this is Derek&#39;s typical style of writing and I love it. I know how hard it is to write this way as I write quite a bit as well (mostly for myself and my research), so really well done. I also, surprisingly, really loved the simplicity of the cover.<br><br>Specific comments:<br><br>1.) For me the &quot;Considerate communication&quot; and &quot;Touch as many of their senses as you can&quot; were two of the most useful chapters in the book at this point in my life. I plan on implementing these techniques when I promote my book. Both are great insights that I hadn’t thought about earlier.<br><br> 2.) &quot;Small gifts go a long way&quot;, &quot;Persistence is polite&quot; and &quot;Repeatedly follow-up to show you care&quot; chapters hit home with me. I’ve done all these things over the years and these have been crucial to whatever career success I have enjoyed till now. One example : It took me four instances to convince my PhD supervisor to take me on as his student :)<br><br>Overall, I think Your Music and People is a great book that will help many creatives and not just musicians. Thank you so much for putting it out in the world.

This book is a gold mine, especially for someone like me who spent his whole life on scales and arpeggios and not very much on relating to people.

While the title of this book might seem to speak to musicians only, I found it to be an excellent book on the art of marketing. While it does a great job of being “a philosophy of getting your work to the world by being creative, considerate, resourceful, and connected.” on a deeper level, it taught me a lot about empathy, about seeing your work from others perspectives and about the act of thinking creatively about the possibilities that abound when you sit down and truly consider, “what is it for?” when it comes to getting your work into the hands of those who you seek to engage with.<br><br>It’s story-filled (and Derek’s stories are always well told, concise and informative), actionable, and also…worth a listen.

Derek brings perspective to everything he does.  Like School of Life, one of its primary values is that it has a clear, consistent and straightforward perspective.<br><br>I went to school for music and do not do it professionally, but the wisdom in the book is applicable to many things.  <br><br>Do you have lots of friends in music, but you do not do it yourself?  Are you a huge fan of music and musicians but you can&#39;t carry a tune in a bucket?  You might actually enjoy this book more than anyone else who reads it, because it&#39;s from the perspective of a person from a group of people you really resonate with and the lessons are portable.  Just buy it and read it.  Each little mini-chapter is doable in only a few minutes.  Like a 5 minute morning or evening meditation.

This is one of the most practical, well written, concise books on philosophy I have read. Even though disguised as extremely useful advise, it is indeed a well thought out philosophy of life and how to navigate some of the turns on the way to wherever you may be headed. If you get the physical copy it will be easier to use a highlighter and fold the corners of the pages that speak to you (my copy of &quot;anything you want&quot; is like that).

I have gained such great perspectives on music &amp; life from Derek Siver’s writings during the past decade. And this book is chock full of his insights.

I don&#39;t make music, I teach yoga and movement but I thought Derek probably has some transferrable wisdom... and I wasn&#39;t disappointed. Your Music and People is full of information and guidance to get your music (or whatever you&#39;re into) out into the world (community) in way that is real to you as well as what people want to hear or experience. Some challenging and thought provoking questions around our money beliefs/taboos and promotion. One piece of advice that really resonated with me :Make up a curious answer to a common question. When asked &quot;What kind of Music/Yoga/Movement do you do? Be creative in your description and don&#39;t be limited by the question but instead make people feel curious about what you do. I highly recommend this book for musicians/anyone else wanting to move their work forward. It&#39;s a short read that packs a big ol punch. Thanks Derek.

I really liked this book, Derek has a knack for transmitting knowledge in a fun and entertaining way, he doesn&#39;t beat around the bush, he is very concise, with very practical advice for any artist, be it a beginner or a professional. This book talks a lot about the importance of the human factor, of the artist&#39;s interpersonal relationships with all the people he meets throughout his career, from the one who sweeps the venue where you are going to play, to a senior executive of a record company, everything is it deals with people, and we must treat them as we would like to be treated.

What I love about &#39;Your Music and People&#39; is that it feels like a collection of windows into new possibilities and mindsets, rather than an explicit and technical music business &#39;how-to&#39; guide. Each chapter planted seeds in my mind, motivating me to grow them in my own personal way. Derek understands that as musicians, artists and creators, we thrive on inspiration and encouragement, and this book is abundant in both.

One of the things I most love about Derek Sivers is the quiet revolution he managed to achieve in the music industry, in his typically unassuming way, with CD Baby. <br><br>This little gem of a book about the music industry - and your and my part in it - is a fabulous read. I refer back to it when I need to remind myself what I&#39;m after, and the price I need to pay to get there.<br><br>Derek is a really great guy, and it shows in this book.

Twenty years ago, Derek Sivers took my phone call when my old band got onto CD Baby. We talked for almost an hour, and I learned more in that hour than in many months previous, trying to launch a band. I’ve often wanted to revisit that conversation. This is the book I’ve been waiting for. I read it (twice) a year ago. Then came Covid and The Great Pause in the music business. For the past week I’ve been re-reading it with highlighter in hand.

I like the short chapters (like the blog). I like that it&#39;s applicable to so many areas (not just music, but also marketing or, in my case, video course creation). And I like the tone (it feels like it&#39;s written for a specific friend and I&#39;m reading over their shoulder).<br><br>I like it so much that I&#39;m rationing myself so that I can only consume a post or two per day.

This book is for anybody who creates anything: artists, creators, inventors, entrepreneurs. <br>We pour our hearts and souls into what we do, but when it comes to putting our work out there, a lot of us suffer, or simply think that we don’t know how to do that. We forget, or don&#39;t realize, that we can be as creative with our marketing. <br><br>This book taught me that the best way to stand out and be remembered is through authenticity and consideration, while being persistent and unafraid to exclude people.  Finding the thin line between these is an art within itself.<br><br>Such a great book!<br><br>One last thought: I read it first and then listened to it a little while later - I was amazed by how my brain focused on different things when I listened to it, and how that offered me a different (or broader) perspective, helping me fine-tune the conclusions. Highly recommend doing that!

I can not say enough great things about this E-Book (Your Music And People) purchase.<br><br>I have been following/knowing Derek Sivers for quite some time now (back when he owned CD Baby). What an amazing guy, so valuable to mankind. Derek has produced and provided so many valuable assets (to us humans) through his years of relentless work efforts with superb output. This E-Book purchase for example (Your Music And People).<br><br>When I started reading this E-book, I was met with feelings of disbelief of the contents/information provided within. This E-Book explains all the major contributing factors (and more), pointing out the appropriate approach needed to be pursued in order to advance in the direction for business success with our music. The E-Book explains everything from how to &quot;Market Music &quot; to how we should &quot;Interact With Our Customers&quot;. This is the same type of valuable information/training that is being advertised all over the internet and individuals must pay large sums of money to receive it&#39;s training. Given the enormous length of experience that Derek has within the music business/industry, it amazes me and I am so grateful that Derek shared &quot;his&quot; valuable wealth of knowledge at such a small price.<br><br>It has always been said that &quot;Knowledge is Power&quot;! Well this E-Book presents both the knowledge and power that one needs to blast them off in the right direction for music business success. Thank you Derek for all you do! What a great man!!!!!!

A few highlights from a remarkable book:<br>—Hate mildly <br>—How you do anything is how you do everything. It matters.<br>—America is the land of overconfidence.<br>—Many people are so worried by looking good that they never accomplish anything great. Many people are so worried by doing something great that they never do anything at all. <br>—Maybe people are just playing their part in the situation you helped create.<br>—Seeking patterns in randomness is called apophenia. (Thanks for that!)<br><br>And through a Derek-esque style conciseness, &quot;Your Music and People&quot;is like a puzzle champion taking over your thinking process you never quite handled properly as a mere human being.  And yet, just like music, a non-fiction &#39;tour-de-force&quot; can &quot;make our life more poetic and beautiful&quot;.

As a hobbyist musician and a fan of Derek&#39;s writing, I had to go through this book. I first listened to it and had this interesting experience: I&#39;m driving on a road trip listening to the book, and I notice that I have my attention on Derek&#39;s words, instead of on the road! I had to stop the audio so I could finish listening to it when I wasn&#39;t driving. Then, I immediately pick up the printed copy so I can highlight passages and write down my notes. Yes, that&#39;s how much I enjoyed the book.<br><br>This book also resonates with me because if we replace &quot;music&quot; and related terms with things I do in my professional life, it still works beautifully, and without all the extra fat we normally get in business books.<br><br>In fact, a co-worker approached me a while ago to co-present a talk that relates music and our business, and I&#39;ll totally be drawing inspiration from this book as well!

Derek&#39;s book Your Music Your People has inevitably become a classic for musicians and other creatives, and a book that you want to have readily accessible. You probably won&#39;t remember all of the wisdom in this book all at once since it’s so concentrated, so you&#39;ll want to refer to it periodically, and come back to it over and over again. On the other hand, it’s a super easy read, and there is no filer. It’s just the best parts, with a few brief stories here and there to add context.

This is what these books read like.<br><br>Well written with a sense of warmth woven throughout. Beautifully concise yet with a lovely flow.<br><br>I got hard cover copies (signed! Thanks, Derek) and was delighted I did so. As these are books you&#39;ll be returning to over the years, with every page to second page ear marked for reference.<br><br>Don&#39;t think &#39;Your Music and People&#39; is for musicians.

Although I am not a musician, as a writer I still enjoyed this book as it was full of uplifting messages and inspiring stories.

But if you are a creative of any sort and would like a gentle kick in the proverbial, this is a great book to pick up from time to time.
